### Project62_TextMiningTimeSeriesLSTM

Files: 1_index.ipynb, 2_tfboard.ipynb
Data: inflation rate, gas prices, Chevron stock prices from 2000 to 2022 (all monthly)
Highlights: Data pre-proccessing, model featuring, ANN, LSTM, Bidrectional LSTM<br>

Overview:<br>
1. Parsing - alpha_vantage, beautifulsoup; sklearn, keras, tensorflow; <br>
ML (LinearReg, Ridge, RandomForestReg, XGBboost); <br>
DL (TimeSeries, ANN, LSTM, Bidrectional LSTM) <br>
2. Data cleaning, EDA, Preprocessing, Model featuring <br>
3. Time Series: Machine Learning, Deep Learning<br>
4. Save transformer to pickle, model checkpoint, tensorboard
5. Conclusion<br>
6. References<br>

Flaws: <br>
- instead of standard scale as a whole, each feature should be normalize and standardized individually.
- not enough detailed data
