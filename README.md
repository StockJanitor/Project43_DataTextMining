### Project62_TextMiningTimeSeriesLSTM

Files: 1_index.ipynb, 2_tensorboard.ipynb

Highlights: Data pre-proccessing, model featuring, ANN, LSTM, Bidrectional LSTM<br>

Overview:<br>
1. Parsing - alpha_vantage, beautifulsoup; ML - sklearn, keras, tensorflow
2. Data cleaning, EDA, Preprocessing, Model featuring <br>
3. Time Series: Machine Learning, Deep Learning<br>
4. Save transformer to pickle, model checkpoint, tensorboard
5. Conclusion<br>
6. References<br>

Flaws: <br>
- the features should be normalize each column individually, then standard scale as a whole.
- not enough detailed data
