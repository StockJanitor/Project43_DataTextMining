### Project62_TextMiningTimeSeriesLSTM

Files: textMiningEV.ipynb

Highlights <br>
Data pre-proccessing, model featuring, ANN, LSTM, Bidrectional LSTM<br>

Overview:<br>
1. Parsing - alpha_vantage, beautifulsoup; ML - sklearn, keras, tensorflow
2. Data cleaning, EDA, Preprocessing, Model featuring <br>
3. Time Series: Machine Learning, Deep Learning<br>
4. Save scaler to pickle, Model checkpoint
5. Conclusion<br>
6. References<br>

Flaws: <rb>
- the features should be normalize each column individually, then standard scale as a whole.
- not enough detailed data
