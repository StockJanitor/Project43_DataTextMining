There’s no Facebook, Twitter, or even a Web; it’s a curious relic of the 80s and 90s that The Entertainment appeared in the form of a VHS tape, rather than an app. “The Entertainment” <em>is</em> a tale of the webs that connect form, content and addiction, along with the societal networks and feedback loops that keep us glued to our screens. David Foster Wallace had the general structure of the user–product interaction correct. That loop isn’t new, of course; it was well-known to TV network executives.

      "<p>We’ve seen the same argument play out on YouTube: when their recommendation algorithm was optimized for how long users would keep their eyeballs on YouTube, resulting in more polarizing conspiracy videos being shown, we were told that YouTube was showing people what they wanted to see. This is a subtle sleight-of-mind, and it’s also wrong. As Zeynep Tufekci <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth\">points out</a>, this is analogous to an automated school cafeteria loading plates with fatty, salty, and sweet food because it has figured out that’s what keeps kids in the cafeteria the longest. What’s also interesting is that YouTube never wrote &#8216;Show more polarizing conspiracy videos&#8217; into their algorithm: that was merely a result of the optimization process. YouTube’s algorithm was measuring what kept viewers there the longest, not what they wanted to see, and feeding them more of the same. Like sugar and fat, conspiracy videos proved to be addictive, regardless of the viewer’s position on any given cause. If “The Entertainment” were posted to YouTube, it would be highly recommended on the platform: viewers can’t leave. It’s the ultimate <a href=\"https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/roach-motel\">virtual roach trap</a>. If that’s not engagement, what is? But it’s clearly not what viewers want–viewers certainly don’t want to forget about food and shelter, not even for a great TV show.&nbsp;<br></p>\n",

In retrospect, the recommendation algorithm’s “logic” is inescapable. If you’re a Democrat, Trump videos made you mad. If you’re a Republican, Trump’s content was designed to make you mad.

Such mixed incentives were even noted by Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page in their 1998 paper <em>The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine</em>, which details their first implementation of the Google Search algorithm. In <a href=\"http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html#a\">Appendix A</a>, aptly titled ‘Advertising and Mixed Motives’, Brin and Page state explicitly that “the goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users” and “we expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.” *Gulp*.

      "<p>YouTube is a case study on the impact of feedback loops on the individual: if I watch something for a certain amount of time, YouTube will recommend similar things to me, for some definition of similar (similarity is defined by broader societal interactions with content), resulting in what we now call “filter bubbles”, a term coined by internet activist Eli Pariser in his 2011 book <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Filter_Bubble.html?id=-FWO0puw3nYC\"><em>The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You</em></a>.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Twitter and Facebook have feedback loops that operate slightly differently, because every user can be both a content provider and a consumer, and the recommendations arise from a network of multi-sided interactions. If I’m sharing content and liking content, the respective algorithms will show me more that is similar to both, resulting in what we call “echo chambers.” These echo chambers represent a different kind of feedback that doesn’t just involve a single user: it’s a feedback loop that involves the user and their connections.

There are runaway <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/artificial-intelligence-is-now-used-predict-crime-is-it-biased-180968337/\">feedback loops in “predictive policing”</a>, whereby more police are sent to neighborhoods with higher “reported &amp; predicted crime,” resulting in more police being sent there and more reports of crime and so on. Due to the information and power asymmetries at play here, along with how such feedback loops discriminate against specific socioeconomic classes, projects such as <a href=\"https://whitecollar.thenewinquiry.com/\"><em>White Collar Crime Risk Zones</em></a>, which maps predictions of white collar crime, are important. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20929337/care-algorithm-study-race-bias-health\">An application that hospitals use to screen for patients</a> with high-risk conditions that require special care wasn’t recommending that care for black patients as often; white patients spend more on health care, making their conditions appear to be more serious. While these applications look completely different, the feedback loop is the same. If you spend more, you get more care; if you police more, you make more arrests. And the cycle goes on. Note that in both cases, a major part of the problem was also the use of proxies for metrics: cost as a proxy for health, police reports a proxy for crime, not dissimilar to the use of Youtube view-time as a proxy for what a viewer <em>wants</em> to watch (for more on metrics and proxies, we <em>highly </em>recommend the post <a href=\"https://www.fast.ai/2019/09/24/metrics/\">The problem with metrics is a big problem for AI</a> by Rachel Thomas, Director of the Center for Applied Data Ethics at USF). There are also interaction effects between many models deployed in society that mean they feedback into each other: those most likely to be treated unfairly by the healthcare algorithm are more likely to be discriminated against by models used in employment hiring flows and more likely to be targeted by predatory payday loan ads online, as detailed by Cathy O’Neil in <a href=\"https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/\">Weapons of Math Destruction</a>.</p>\n",

      "<p>Google search operates at another scale of networked feedback, that of <em>everybody</em>. When I search for “Artificial Intelligence,” the results aren’t only a function of what Google knows about me, but also of how successful each link has been for everybody that has seen it previously. Google Search also operates in a fundamentally different way to many modern recommendation systems: historically, it has optimized its results to get you off its platform, though recently <a href=\"https://qz.com/1540608/the-problem-with-silicon-valleys-obsession-with-blitzscaling-growth/\">its emphasis has shifted</a>. Whereas so many tech companies optimize for engagement with their platforms, trying to keep you from going elsewhere, Google’s incentive with Search was to direct you to another site, most often for the purpose of discovering facts. Under this model, there is an argument that the incentives of Google, advertisers, and users were all aligned, at least when searching for basic facts: all three stakeholders <em>want </em>to get the right fact in front of the user, at least in theory. This is why Search weighs long clicks more heavily than short clicks (the longer the time before the user clicks back to Google, the better).&nbsp; Now that Google has <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/antitrust-regulators-are-using-the-wrong-tools-to-break-up-big-tech\">shifted to providing answers to questions</a> rather than links to answers, they are valuing engagement with their platform over engagement with other advertisers; as an advertiser, you’re more likely to succeed if you advertise directly on Google’s result page. Even more recently, Google <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/search/search-language-understanding-bert/\">announced</a> its incorporation of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, a technology enabling “anyone to train their own state-of-the-art question answering system”) into Search, which will allow users to make more complex and conversational queries and will enable you to “search in a way that feels natural for you” (according to Google, this is “one of the biggest leaps forward in the history of Search”). Fundamental changes in Search to encourage more complex queries could result in a shift of incentives.&nbsp;<br></p>\n",

      "\n",

      "<p>Also, this theoretical alignment of incentives between Google, advertisers, and users is an idealization. In practice, Google search encodes all types of cultural and societal biases, such as racial discrimination, as investigated in Safiya Noble’s <a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/\"><em>Algorithms of Oppression</em></a>. An example of this is that, for many years, when using Google image search with the keyword “beautiful,” the results would be dominated by photos of white women. In the words of <a href=\"https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/\">Ruha Benjamin</a>, Associate Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University, “race and technology are co-produced.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>A final word (for now) on developing healthy Google Search habits and practices: know that the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) industry is worth close to $80 billion and that the way you’re served results and the potential mis-alignment of incentives depends on whether your search is <em>informational </em>(searching for information, such as “Who was the 44th President of the United States?”), <em>navigational </em>(searching for a particular website, such as “Wikipedia”), or <em>transactional </em>(searching to buy something, such as “Buy Masterclass subscription”). Keep a skeptical mind about the results you’re served! Personalization of search results may be handy in the short-term.&nbsp; However, when making informational searches, you’re being served what you regularly assume is ground truth but is tailored to you, based on what Google already knows about your online and, increasingly, offline behavior. There is also an information asymmetry, in that you don’t know what Google knows about you, and how that information plays into the incentives of Google’s ad-based business model. For informational searches, this could be quite disturbing. As Jaron Lanier points out in <a href=\"http://www.jaronlanier.com/tenarguments.html\"><em>Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now</em></a>, how would you feel if Wikipedia showed you and I different histories, based on our respective browser activities? To take this a step further, what if Wikipedia tailored the “facts” served to us as a function of an ad-based business model?<br></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>For advertisers, incentive systems are also strangely skewed. We recently searched for Stitch Fix, the online personal styling service. This is a basic navigational search and Google could easily have served us the Stitch Fix website and they did, but above it were two advertisements: the first one was for Stitch Fix and the second one was for Trunk Club, a Stitch Fix competitor. This means that Trunk Club is buying ads for the keywords of their competitor, a common practice, and Stitch Fix then had to engage in defensive advertising due to how much traffic Google Search has, even when the user is clearly looking for their product! As a result, the user sees only ads above the scroll (at least on a cell phone) and needs to scroll down to find the correct and obvious search result. There is an argument that, if a user is explicitly searching to buy a product, it should be illegal for Google to force the product in question into defensive advertising.</p>\n",

      "<p>COBOL is one of the earliest programming languages; it was invented in 1960 and rose to prominence fairly quickly as a language that required minimal programming skills. (Real programmers wrote FORTRAN.) That&#8217;s not how COBOL’s inventors put it, but that is, to some extent, what they meant: a language that was supposed to be easy for programmers to learn, and that could also be understood by business people. Just look at what COBOL stands for: &#8220;Common Business-Oriented Language.&#8221; A programming language for business.<br></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>COBOL&#8217;s influence faded in the 1980s, and now, there are billions of lines of code in governments, banks, enterprises, and elsewhere performing essential business functions with nobody to maintain them. COBOL programmers have grown old and retired, and nobody came along afterward.<br></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>What&#8217;s the language like? I’ve had occasion to look at COBOL code, and my reaction hasn&#8217;t been what I expected. It doesn&#8217;t look like any &#8220;modern&#8221; language. But it&#8217;s not a strange antique from the days before people knew how to design decent languages. COBOL is a well-thought-out domain-specific language. It&#8217;s a business language that uses the language of businesspeople. Remember when Rubyists were proud that they could write statements that looked like idiomatic English? And that they could use metaprogramming to create domain-specific languages that used the vocabularies and concepts of different application domains? That was no small achievement. And COBOL did it 40-odd years earlier.<br></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Like other useful languages, COBOL never disappeared; but it has had surprisingly little influence on the development of computer languages, and that makes it look like it has died. In <a href=\"https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/influential-dead-languages/\">10 Most(ly) Dead Influential Programming Languages</a>, Hillel Wayne argues that COBOL had little influence on the development of programming languages because it came from the business community, and academics weren&#8217;t interested in it—for academics, it &#8220;wasn&#8217;t worth paying attention to.&#8221; Who wants to write code that&#8217;s readable by bankers and business people anyway? The allure of speaking a secret language that nobody else understood was always attractive to programmers.<br></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>COBOL nevertheless made a number of important innovations. It had a concept of records (like rows in a database), which was related to a concept of hierarchical structures, looking forward to C structs and perhaps even objects. And it has a report generator—if that doesn&#8217;t sound interesting, remember that one of the initial applications for Perl was report generation. And that another nearly forgotten early language, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RPG\">RPG</a>, was invented purely to generate reports. Reports aren&#8217;t glamorous, but they&#8217;re important.<br></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Syntactically, COBOL asked a really good question: Why do we need to use the bastardized language of mathematics to move money around, by saying something like &#8220;total = total + deposit&#8221;? Wouldn&#8217;t it be more natural to MOVE amounts from one account to another? Don&#8217;t get too excited. MOVE sounds like a proto-transaction, but it isn&#8217;t; it&#8217;s just an assignment. However, if you&#8217;re thinking about MOVE-ing money rather than assignment to a variable, those thoughts will lead you to atomic transactional operations sooner rather than later.<br></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a lot that COBOL doesn&#8217;t offer. While COBOL has been updated with most of the features you’d expect in a modern language (since 2002, it’s even object-oriented), COBOL tends to lead to very awkward spaghetti code and monoliths. That&#8217;s 1960s programming for you. GOTO was an essential part of every programming language (even C has a goto statement). Modularization wasn&#8217;t well-understood, if it was understood at all. Libraries? The earliest versions of COBOL didn&#8217;t have a standard library, let alone user-defined libraries. Web frameworks? You don’t want to know. Microservices? Forget it.<br></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>So, where are we now, with our billions of lines of COBOL running the world’s governments, and finances? I doubt there are many 1960s mainframes left, but there are plenty of emulations of 1960s mainframes running COBOL in the cloud much faster than the hardware it ran on initially. And that&#8217;s one strategy I&#8217;ve seen for maintaining COBOL: leave it as it is, run it on an emulator, wrap it up in a microservice written in some “modern” language, and hope you never have to touch it. That buys time, but while “hope” may solve the immediate problem, it’s a poor long-term strategy.<br></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The real problem isn&#8217;t just the lack of programmers fluent in a language that is no longer popular. There are also cultural problems that need to be addressed—and that have solutions that go beyond &#8220;train up a new batch of COBOL programmers.&#8221; First, one casualty of the &#8220;language wars&#8221; of the 90s and 00s is that we have an increasing number of programmers who identify with one language: they&#8217;re JavaScript programmers, or Java programmers, or Python programmers, or Rubyists. Dave Thomas’ and Andy Hunt’s advice to <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OneLanguage.html\">learn a new programming language every year</a> is just as valid as it was when they first wrote <a href=\"http://www.programmr.com/blogs/learn-new-programming-language-every-year\"><em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em></a>; but it goes sadly unheeded. To be a good programmer, you need to expose yourself to new ideas, new ways of thinking about problems—and, in the case of COBOL, old ideas. Programmers who can&#8217;t be coaxed out of their comfort zone aren&#8217;t going to learn COBOL; but in the long run, they&#8217;ll prove to be less valuable, regardless of what modern language they know.<br></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Second, COBOL programming requires an understanding of business programming. Regardless of the language, that&#8217;s an increasingly rare specialty. How do you handle financial quantities, like dollars and cents? If you say &#8220;floating point,&#8221; go to the back of the class. Roundoff errors will kill you. If you say &#8220;use integers, and divide by 100,&#8221; that&#8217;s not much better. The fundamental problem is that binary numbers are not good at representing decimal fractional values. But that&#8217;s lore that most current programmers have never learned.&nbsp; (And we haven’t even started thinking about currency conversions.)<br></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Third, engineering decisions made in the 1960s, 1970s, and even 1980s aren’t the decisions we’d make today. The engineering was certainly valid for its time, but modern engineers frequently don’t understand why. I&#8217;ve heard many contemporary programmers talk about the Y2K problem (representing years in the 1900s with two digits) as &#8220;technical debt.&#8221; That represents a misunderstanding of the issues the original programmers faced. In an environment when data was entered on 80-column punched cards, saving 2 characters was a Big Deal. In an environment where the largest computers had memories measured in Kilobytes (and a small number of K at that), saving 2 characters was a Big Deal. This isn&#8217;t engineering that has to be replicated, but it does need to be understood.&nbsp;<br></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Fourth, old business software was monolithic—and monolithic in a very deep sense. It tended to model forms that humans would fill out, and that couldn’t be submitted until the form was complete. There&#8217;s often no way to save your work, because—why would you need to? You went to the unemployment office in person; you leave when you hand the application to the person behind the desk. An incomplete form goes into the wastebasket; why waste valuable storage on it? Putting a web interface in front of those monoliths leads to a predictable result: long, complex forms that can take hours to fill out, and that are close to unusable on the modern Web. In creating <a href=\"https://www.codeforamerica.org/news/california-launches-code-for-americas-getcalfresh-in-all-58-counties\">GetCalFresh</a>, a streamlined application for food assistance in California, <a href=\"https://www.codeforamerica.org/\">Code for America</a> found that the old form took an hour to fill out—but applicants often relied on public computers in libraries that didn’t allow sessions longer than a half-hour. Since incomplete forms couldn’t be saved, it was impossible for applicants to finish applying. Moving a COBOL application to an emulator, running it in the cloud, and hacking together a Web frontend isn&#8217;t going to solve problems like this. The good news is that this is an opportunity to re-think your service and make it more effective. The bad news is that it’s not a quick fix.<br></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>So, what&#8217;s needed? Yes, we need more people who know and understand COBOL programs. There&#8217;s a lot of old code that needs to be maintained, pure and simple. But it goes deeper. COBOL is just another programming language; if we&#8217;re going to maintain (or replace) that software, we need programmers who understand the engineering decisions that made the software what it is. We also need engineers and managers who are willing to look at our current situation—for example, the huge surge in unemployment applications—and think beyond the short-term solution. What does it take to re-invent current systems, rather than just replace them? How can they become more human-centric? Can they be redesigned to match the way we live and work now? Putting a web front-end on a monolithic business process from the 1950s is the road to failure.<br></p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>That&#8217;s the new generation of COBOL programmers that we need: people to do the tedious, unglamorous work of re-inventing, re-engineering, and automating government applications, business applications, and much more. Reimagining these processes is creative work, but it requires a different kind of creativity from implementing a new website. I previously wrote about the distinction between <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/toward-the-next-generation-of-programming-tools/\">blue- and white-collar programming</a>. COBOL is very, very blue-collar. And very, very important. Every time the cry for COBOL programmers has gone up, we’ve muddled through; this time, we should do something better.<br></p>\n",

You can hire compliance experts to advise you, and lawyers to defend you. That said, compliance allows plenty of room for bad, unethical behavior. For example, payday lending businesses are no doubt compliant with the law, but <a href=\"https://sevenpillarsinstitute.org/payday-lending-an-ethics-evaluation/\">many aren’t</a> models for good corporate citizenship.</p>\n",

It’s about living a “good” life, acting in a way that allows you to live with yourself and others. There aren’t simple standards and tests for ethical behavior, nor are you as likely to be called into court for acting unethically. But unethical behavior is likely to lose your customers’ or business partners’ <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/19/americans-perceptions-about-unethical-behavior-shape-how-they-think-about-people-in-powerful-roles/\">trust</a>; they will view your actions with suspicion. </p>\n",

The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for instance, imposes fines of up to 2%–4% of global annual revenue. This could mean millions, if not billions, of lost revenue.

      "Governance and Discovery\n",
      "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/bDh1ARjfuqw/\n",
      "<p><em>Data Governance</em> sounds like a candidate for the most boring topic in technology: something dreamed up by middle-managers to add friction to data scientists&#8217; lives. The funny thing about governance, though, is that it’s closely related to data discovery. And data discovery is neither dull nor additional friction; it&#8217;s an exciting process that enables great data projects, ranging from traditional reporting to artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The idea of data governance originated in regulation and compliance. Not that long ago, data was a “wild west”: there were few rules and regulations about how it could be used or transferred, and most were industry-specific. That started to change with HIPAA, which covered medical data (though not much else). It changed in a big way with Europe&#8217;s GDPR, which enacted stringent requirements for how data is used and how individuals control the use of data about themselves; it also provided significant penalties for organizations that disobeyed the rules. In the US, California enacted a data privacy law (CCPA) that is similar to GDPR in many ways, and other states are likely to follow.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The need for data governance is simple. People who work with data need to take those regulations into account. They need to track the data they have, where it came from, who was allowed to modify it, and how it was modified. If their dataset merges multiple data sources, they have to track those other sources. They need to be able to find and delete data on short notice if a customer requests it (for example, by exercising the GDPR’s “right to be forgotten”). They need to know how the data was collected—not just whether consent was requested and granted, but how their data sources were chosen. Who (or what) appears in the dataset? Are the data sources biased, and how might those biases affect results? And this requires a set of tools that is more sophisticated than dumping the data into a data warehouse or submerging it in a data lake. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>But a funny thing happened. At the same time that companies had to prepare for increased regulation and scrutiny, they were also becoming more sophisticated about how they were using data. They were experimenting with machine learning and artificial intelligence; they were building models that could easily go astray (with embarrassing repercussions) if they were based on data that was out of date or erroneous. And they realized that their data science teams were spending an inordinate amount of time searching for data, which was frequently locked up in a departmental silo or submerged in a data swamp. They often compounded the time spent searching when they realized, after starting their analysis, the data they found was unusable. It was stale, incorrect, incomplete, badly described, or subject to any of a dizzying number of problems. If your data isn&#8217;t trustworthy, the results you get from that data won&#8217;t be trustworthy, either.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>What did the data scientists need? Tools to help them find relevant data, understand its schema, understand how it was collected, understand how and where it was used and whether they could trust it. What did the compliance experts need? Tools to help them find relevant data, understand its schema so they knew just what was included in the data, understand how the data was collected, how and where it was used, and whether they could trust it. Pretty soon, people realized that these were almost exactly the same problem.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>The problem boils down to managing metadata—the data about the data, the data that describes the data. Companies need to manage their metadata so they know what their data means: how it was collected, how the data is represented, how the columns in a table are defined, when the data was updated, and even how frequently it is accessed. Data that hasn’t been used for a few years probably hasn’t been used for a good reason. Companies also need to track restrictions on data’s use, who is allowed to access it, who is allowed to change it, and much more. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010.pdf\">Datasheets for Datasets</a> describes some of the metadata that has to be tracked to manage data effectively. Managing this metadata has often been handled by a “data steward”; but as data scales, delegating metadata management to a single person becomes ineffective. It&#8217;s impossible to keep up with all the data flowing into an organization—even a small one.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>And that&#8217;s what makes data governance interesting. It&#8217;s not just a requirement that&#8217;s imposed by external regulators. It&#8217;s about the process of understanding what data you have, what that data means, and how to use it. And it&#8217;s surprising (well, not to any data scientist) how few companies actually understand the data they have, and what they can do with it. And once you understand your data—what you have, what it means, where it came from—you’re finally in a position to use it effectively.</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>How does this look in practice? The open source project <a href=\"https://github.com/lyft/amundsen\">Amundsen</a> was started to enable <a href=\"https://eng.lyft.com/amundsen-lyfts-data-discovery-metadata-engine-62d27254fbb9\">data discovery at Lyft</a>. It enables data scientists to search for data in Lyft&#8217;s “data lake,” and implements something like Google&#8217;s PageRank algorithm to rank relevant data sources. It also tracks who has accessed the data, how often, and when; data that is used frequently is more likely to be well-maintained. Although Amundsen was built to solve a supposedly different problem, it has also become a tool for data governance. It’s really about metadata management, and that’s at the heart of data governance.&nbsp; </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>It’s also important to think about what metadata management tools like Amundsen <em>don’t</em> provide. Amundsen tracks data access, so there’s a virtual “paper trail” about how data was used, but it doesn&#8217;t implement any kind of access control. It won’t prevent someone from accessing data they shouldn’t; it just lets you document what happened after the fact. It’s better at tracking down a violation than preventing one. It also doesn&#8217;t track data lineage (at least, not yet), although users can add metadata about how data is modified and remixed. So it’s not a complete solution—but it’s a step toward a solution. </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Going beyond metadata management, many data governance platforms are designed to enforce data access policies. They go beyond leaving a “paper trail” by restricting data access to those who have appropriate credentials, even on a record-by-record basis. They can also track data lineage, build data catalogs, and search for relevant data. Most of the commercial tools provide explicit support for regulatory compliance, such as GDPR and CPPA.&nbsp; </p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Regardless of the tools, data governance and data discovery go together. You can’t use your data if you can’t find it. You can’t use your data if you don’t even know what data you have. And you’re still at risk of data breaches, legal liability, and violating customer’s trust, even if—especially if—you don’t know what data you have. Data governance starts with metadata. And once you understand that, you understand that by requiring you to manage your metadata, data governance is an enabler, not a hindrance. That’s when you can really think productively about how to use your data</p>\n",

      "What you need to know about product management for AI\n",
      "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/pqmrP2XDVmU/\n",
      "<p>If you’re already a software product manager (PM), you have a head start on becoming a PM for artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML). You already know the game and how it is played: you’re the coordinator who ties everything together, from the developers and designers to the executives. You’re responsible for the design, the product-market fit, and ultimately for getting the product out the door. But there’s a host of new challenges when it comes to managing AI projects: more unknowns, non-deterministic outcomes, new infrastructures, new processes and new tools. A lot to learn, but worthwhile to access the unique and special value AI can create in the product space.</p>\n",
      "<p>Whether you manage customer-facing AI products, or internal AI tools, you will need to ensure your projects are in sync with your business. This means that the AI products you build align with your existing business plans and strategies (or that your products are driving change in those plans and strategies), that they are delivering value to the business, and that they are delivered on time. A PM for AI needs to do everything a traditional PM does, but they also need an operational understanding of machine learning software development along with a realistic view of its capabilities and limitations.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Why AI software development is different</h2>\n",
      "<p>AI products are automated systems that collect and learn from data to make user-facing decisions. Pragmatically, machine learning is the part of AI that “works”: algorithms and techniques that you can implement now in real products. We won’t go into the mathematics or engineering of modern machine learning here. All you need to know for now is that machine learning uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to &#8220;learn&#8221; by being trained on existing data. After training, the system can make predictions (or deliver other results) based on data it hasn’t seen before.</p>\n",
      "<p>AI systems differ from traditional software in many ways, but the biggest difference is that machine learning shifts engineering from a deterministic process to a probabilistic one. Instead of writing code with hard-coded algorithms and rules that always behave in a predictable manner, ML engineers collect a large number of examples of input and output pairs and use them as training data for their models.</p>\n",
      "<p>For example, if engineers are training a neural network, then this data teaches the network to approximate a function that behaves similarly to the pairs they pass through it. In the best case scenario, the trained neural network accurately represents the underlying phenomenon of interest and produces the correct output even when presented with new input data the model didn’t see during training. For machine learning systems used in consumer internet companies, models are often continuously retrained many times a day using billions of entirely new input-output pairs.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Machine learning adds uncertainty</h2>\n",
      "<p>With machine learning, we often get a system that is statistically more accurate than simpler techniques, but with the tradeoff that some small percentage of model predictions will always be incorrect, sometimes in ways that are hard to understand.</p>\n",
      "<p>This shift requires a fundamental change in your software engineering practice. The same neural network code trained with seemingly similar datasets of input and output pairs can give entirely different results. The model outputs produced by the same code will vary with changes to things like the size of the training data (number of labeled examples), network training parameters, and training run time. This has serious implications for software testing, versioning, deployment, and other core development processes.</p>\n",
      "<p>For any given input, the same program won’t necessarily produce the same output; the output depends entirely on how the model was trained. Make changes to the training data, repeat the training process with the same code, and you’ll get different output predictions from your model. Maybe the differences will be subtle, maybe they’ll be substantial, but they’ll be different.</p>\n",
      "<p>The model is produced by code, but it isn’t code; it’s an artifact of the code and the training data. That data is never as stable as we’d like to think. As your user base grows, the demographics and behavior of the user population in production shift away from your initial training data, which was based on early adopters. Models also become stale and outdated over time. To make things even more challenging, the real world adapts to your model’s predictions and decisions. A model for detecting fraud will make some kinds of fraud harder to commit–and bad actors will react by inventing new kinds of fraud, invalidating the original model. Models within AI products change the same world they try to predict.</p>\n",
      "<p>Underneath this uncertainty lies further uncertainty in the development process itself. It’s hard to predict how long an AI project will take. Predicting development time is hard enough for traditional software, but at least we can make some general guesses based on past experience. We know what “progress” means. With AI, you often don’t know what’s going to happen until you try it. It isn’t uncommon to spend weeks or even months before you find something that works and improves model accuracy from 70% to 74%. It’s hard to tell whether the biggest model improvement will come from better <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/designing-your-neural-networks-a5e4617027ed\">neural network design</a>, <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/representation/feature-engineering\">input features</a>, or training data. You often can’t tell a manager that the model will be finished next week or next month; your next try may be the one that works, or you may be frustrated for weeks. You frequently don’t know whether something is feasible until you do the experiment.</p>\n",

      "<p>Planning and estimation are difficult for AI products because it is rare to find two real-world systems where the training data and algorithms applied are the same.</p>\n",
      "<p>Imagine you are a data scientist at Disney. Your division is starting a new video streaming service and you’re tasked with building a system to recommend movies. You might establish a baseline by replicating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering\">collaborative filtering</a> models published by teams that built recommenders for MovieLens, Netflix, and Amazon. There may even be someone on your team who built a personalized video recommender before and can help scope and estimate the project requirements using that past experience as a point of reference.</p>\n",
      "<p>In this scenario, your Disney team appears to be solving a problem similar to the early <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize\">Netflix Prize</a> recommendation problem. You have a highly curated catalog with a small number of professionally produced movies and TV series, and need to recommend those items to users based on their interests and viewing habits. Your team also needs to solve a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_start_(computing)\">cold start problem</a> so you can recommend movies before the system begins collecting user feedback data (typically solved by using contextual topic-based or popularity-based recommendations), but once you gather explicit user ratings and video viewing data, you should be able to build a reasonable system. It may even be faster to launch this new recommender system, because the Disney data team has access to published research describing what worked for other teams.</p>\n",
      "<p>But this is a best-case scenario, and it’s not typical. What if instead of a narrow, curated video catalog, you were building a <a href=\"https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45530\">recommender system for a consumer video app</a>, where anyone could create and upload user-generated content (UGC)? You might have millions of <a href=\"http://ai-lab-challenge.bytedance.com/tce/vc/\">short videos</a>, with user ratings and limited metadata about the creators or content. Social and trending signals in this network will be important, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/01/25/youtube-is-changing-its-algorithms-stop-recommending-conspiracies/\">controlling spam and abuse</a> will be a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-youtube-overrun-with-bogus-cancer-treatment-claims-11562072401\">challenge</a>. It may even be necessary to do <a href=\"https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45619\">image or video analysis</a> to make content-based recommendations, detect fraud, or reject content that violates your rules (for example, live shooter videos). You could still begin by shipping a simple cold-start recommender system, but it will take you much longer to build and iterate on your model to achieve the level of accuracy the business expects. You will likely encounter many challenges training your recommender with large amounts of constantly changing UGC and <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3346997\">conflicting objectives</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p>These issues may be unexpected for teams that aren’t familiar with developing machine learning systems trained on user-generated content. If you ignore these complications during planning and assume your system will behave similarly to the original recommenders at Netflix, the project will end up significantly behind schedule, and may have serious abuse problems that Netflix didn’t face. In each of these examples, the machine learning problem faced by the business was similar (recommend movies to users), but the required approach ended up being very different based on subtle differences in the data and product design.</p>\n",
      "<p>Predicting development time becomes even more difficult when you apply an algorithm successfully used in one domain to a different problem. Consider using the Netflix collaborative filtering algorithm to recommend jobs to job seekers. On the surface, these problems seem similar: we have a dataset of items (jobs) and users (job seekers), so, in theory, we could use a job seeker’s history of saved jobs or job applications to recommend similar new jobs. Complications arise when you consider the nuances of recruiting data and job applications. Features like geography and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/96116/ad-targeting-by-job-seniority-overview?lang=en\">job seniority</a> are critical to getting a good match. Job postings have a much shorter relevant lifetime than movies, so content-based features and metadata about the company, skills, and education requirements will be more important in this case. Job recommendations also include additional <a href=\"https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2018/10/building-representative-talent-search-at-linkedin\">algorithmic and regulatory challenges</a> related to diversity, bias, and fairness that are not encountered in movie recommendations.</p>\n",
      "<p>The point isn’t that estimating AI projects is intractably hard; it’s that you aren’t likely to succeed if you expect an AI project to behave like a traditional software project. There are strategies for dealing with all of this uncertainty–starting with the proverb from the early days of Agile: “<a href=\"http://wiki.c2.com/?DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork\">do the simplest thing that could possibly work</a>.” You don’t always need to start with a complex neural network; a simple regression (or even simpler, an average) might be enough to get your project off the ground. In some cases, that simple model may be all you ever need. The biggest problems arise from taking shortcuts and assuming that a machine learning model that works for one application will perform well in a different context without looking at the underlying data.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Organizational prerequisites for AI at scale</h2>\n",
      "<p>Particularly at a company that’s new to AI, part of an AI product manager’s job is helping the organization build the culture it needs to succeed with AI. Because it’s so different from traditional software development, where the risks are more or less well-known and predictable, AI rewards people and companies that are willing to take intelligent risks, and that have (or can develop) an experimental culture. As Jeff Bezos has <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/17-jeff-bezos-quotes-that-suddenly-take-on-a-whole-new-meaning-after-2-stunning-decisions.html\">said</a>, “If you only do things where you know the answer in advance, your company goes away.”</p>\n",
      "<p>No company wants to dry up and go away; and at least if you follow the media buzz, machine learning gives companies real competitive advantages in prediction, planning, sales, and almost every aspect of their business. If machine learning is so amazing, why hasn’t every company applied it and reinvented itself?</p>\n",
      "<p>Even simple machine learning projects can be difficult, and managing these projects in a real business is <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/04/the-first-wave-of-corporate-ai-is-doomed-to-fail\">much harder</a> than most people realize; that’s why VentureBeat claims <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/\">87% of machine learning products never make it into production</a>, and Harvard Business Review says that “<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/04/the-first-wave-of-corporate-ai-is-doomed-to-fail\">The first wave of corporate AI is bound to fail</a>.” Machine learning is not fairy dust you can sprinkle on your existing product. You can’t just plug in off-the-shelf cloud APIs that will magically make your product intelligent. Machine learning requires a complete rethinking; your products and your workflows are likely to change in fundamental ways. Product managers for AI need to lead that rethinking.</p>\n",
      "<p><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/\">VentureBeat</a> discusses two reasons for failure: management that believes you can solve problems by throwing money at them (whether that means hiring more, or better, developers), and data that is locked away into silos, where the people building your ML applications can’t get it. These are fundamentally cultural problems. You need to understand that many solutions can’t be bought (yet), that AI products require collaboration between teams, that data silos stand in the way of success, and that the best remedy for failure is picking yourself up and trying again. (To be clear, we are not saying that data can or should be used indiscriminately, without concern for legal compliance, customer privacy, bias, and other ethical issues.)</p>\n",
      "<p>The need for an experimental culture implies that machine learning is currently better suited to the consumer space than it is to enterprise companies. For <a href=\"https://blog.tryexponent.com/consumer-enterprise-product-management/\">enterprise products</a>, requirements often come from a small number of vocal customers with large accounts. It’s difficult to be experimental when your business is built on long-term relationships with customers who often dictate what they want. Measurement, tracking, and logging is less of a priority in enterprise software. An enterprise company like Oracle has a lot of customers, but Oracle’s customer base is dwarfed by Amazon’s or Walmart’s. Consumer product management is typically more bottom-up, driven by large volumes of user feedback and usage tracking data. Many consumer internet companies invest heavily in analytics infrastructure, instrumenting their online product experience to measure and improve user retention. It turns out that type of data infrastructure is also the foundation needed for building AI products.</p>\n",
      "<p>The ability to make decisions based on data analytics is a prerequisite for an “experimental culture.” This was the path taken by companies like Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, which were <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/data-driven/9781491925454/\">driven by analytics</a> from the beginning. At measurement-obsessed companies, every part of their product experience is quantified and adjusted to optimize user experience.</p>\n",
      "<p>These companies eventually moved beyond using data to inform product design decisions. They have deployed machine learning at scale to recommend movies and friends, personalize ads, and deliver search results. Their user agreements <a href=\"https://safety.google/privacy/data/\">allow them to use data</a> to improve their products. They’ve built the infrastructure needed to collect, manage, and analyze their data, and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@jamal.robinson/how-facebook-scales-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-693706ae296f\">deploy AI products</a> that can automatically make user-facing decisions in real time. By putting these pieces together, these companies created an environment where machine learning discoveries and innovation in AI are an integral property of their culture.</p>\n",
      "<p>You are unlikely to succeed at AI if you haven’t laid a proper foundation for it. That foundation means that you have already shifted the culture and data infrastructure of your company. In “<a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007\">The AI Hierarchy of Needs</a>,” Monica Rogati argues that you can build an AI capability only after you’ve built a solid data infrastructure, including data collection, data storage, data pipelines, data preparation, and traditional analytics. If you can’t walk, you’re unlikely to run. Just as AI product managers need to help build a culture in which they can succeed, they need to help define and build the infrastructure that will allow an organization to walk, and then to run.</p>\n",
      "<p>If you’re just learning to walk, there are ways to speed up your progress. Although machine learning projects differ in subtle ways from traditional projects, they tend to require similar infrastructure, similar data collection processes, and similar developer habits. A relatively narrow project, like an intelligent search interface for your product, will require you to develop a lot of the basics, starting with the ability to acquire, clean, store, and analyze data. You’ll become familiar with the problems that real-world data presents. You’ll have to build the infrastructure that data projects require. Most important, you’ll start building relationships with other teams–and those relationships will become crucial when you tackle bigger projects.</p>\n",
      "<p>The prospect of taking on a costly data infrastructure project is daunting. If your company is starting out on this path, it’s important to recognize that there are now widely available open source tools and commercial platforms that can power this foundation for you. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@l2k/how-to-build-a-machine-learning-team-when-you-are-not-google-or-facebook-f639238eafa2\">According to Lukas Biewald</a>, founder of Figure Eight and Weights &amp; Biases: “Big companies should avoid building their own machine learning infrastructure. Almost every tech company I talk to is building their own custom machine learning stack and has a team that’s way too excited about doing this.”</p>\n",
      "<p>If you are still figuring out your analytics strategy, you are fighting the last war. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be thinking about AI, but it’s a goal, not the next step. Start with a simple project, build your infrastructure, learn how to use your data effectively, build relationships within the organization, then make the leap.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Identifying “viable” machine learning problems</h2>\n",
      "<p>Any product manager is part of the team that determines what product to build. If you are just starting out with AI, that decision is especially important–and difficult. The stakes are high–and you can be pardoned if you’re uncomfortable with ideas that are expensive and have an uncertain probability of success. Product managers are more comfortable with roadmaps that can get to market value in the next 12 months, and costs that can be kept to a minimum. AI doesn’t fit that model. An AI pilot project, even one that sounds simple, probably won’t be something you can demo quickly. You will struggle to make the case to invest in research upfront.</p>\n",
      "<p>Therefore, you need to pay particular attention to defining a “minimum viable product” (MVP). How do you find an MVP, with the stress on both “minimum” and “viable”? What features should be deferred to later versions, and what belongs in the initial release? A demo, or even a first release, can be based on heuristics or simple models (linear regression, or even averages). Having something you can demo takes some of the pressure off your machine learning team. But you still need to answer the question: how do you tell the difference between technology you can productize now, and that which will be viable in an uncertain time frame? Most interesting things in AI are on the cutting edge of what we can do in engineering, and that makes them unpredictable: you don’t know when the engineering team will have the insight needed to make the product work. Those cutting-edge ideas are also attractive, both to managers who don’t understand the risks and to developers who want to try something that’s really challenging. And you, as the product manager, are caught between them.</p>\n",
      "<p>Effective product managers for AI know the difference between easy, hard, and impossible problems. A good example of a problem that has been hard or impossible <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03186\">until recently</a> is generative text summarization. It seems like it should be within reach of our current machine learning algorithms, but in practice, accurately summarizing arbitrary text is still beyond the state of the art. You can generate text that, at first glance, appears to be written by a human, but upon closer inspection, you will often find it filled with factual and grammatical errors unacceptable in most business applications. This the “art of the possible,” an intuition for what is and isn’t feasible. It’s an intuition that you can learn through experience–and it’s why understanding your failures is at least as important as understanding your successes.</p>\n",
      "<p>For AI products, one important part of being “feasible” is being precisely defined. As Jeremy Jordan says, “<a href=\"https://www.jeremyjordan.me/ml-requirements/\">A problem well-defined is half solved</a>.” It’s easy to look at the many successes of AI over the past few years and think that there’s some magic, but there really isn’t. If you can state what you want to accomplish very precisely, and break that down into even simpler problems, you’re off to a good start. Jordan has some good advice: start by solving the problem yourself, by hand. If you want to help customers organize pictures on their phones, spend some time on your phone, organizing pictures. Interview actual customers to see what they want. Build a prototype they can try with real data. Above all, don’t think that “we want to help customers organize pictures” is a sufficient problem statement. It isn’t; you’ve got to go into much more detail about who your customers are, how they want to organize their pictures, what kinds of pictures they’re likely to have, how they want to search, and more.</p>\n",
      "<p>Another good proxy for identifying “viable” machine learning problems is to see how quickly you can construct a labeled benchmark dataset along with clear, narrowly defined accuracy goals for your ML algorithm. Data labeling ease is a good proxy for whether machine learning is cost effective. If you can build data labeling into normal user activities within your product (for example, flagging spam emails), then you have a shot at gathering enough input-output pairs to train your model. Otherwise, you will burn money paying external services for labeled data, and that up-front cost–before you can do your first demo–can easily be the most expensive part of the project. Without large amounts of good raw and labeled training data, solving most AI problems is not possible.</p>\n",
      "<p>Even with good training data and a clear objective metric, it can be difficult to reach accuracy levels sufficient to satisfy end users or upper management. When you’re planning a product, it’s important to have a gut feel for what error rates are achievable and what aren’t, and what error rates are acceptable for your application. Product recommendations are easy; nobody is injured if you recommend products that your customers don’t want, though you won’t see much ROI. Fraud detection is riskier; you’re working with real money, and errors show up in your bottom line. Autonomous vehicles are a different matter; if you’re building an autonomous vehicle, you need AI that is close to perfect. (And perfect will never be achievable.) That kind of difference has a tremendous effect on how you structure the development process.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Work on things that matter to your business</h2>\n",
      "<p>The most important advice we can give is to make sure you work on AI products that matter to the business. It’s entirely too easy to define a problem, spend three to six months solving it, and then find out the solution works, but nobody cares; it doesn’t make a difference to the business. One of a product manager’s most important jobs is ensuring that the team is solving a problem that’s worth solving.</p>\n",
      "<p>If you have a good data team and an intuitive understanding of your company’s data, there should be no shortage of ideas around how to improve your product. You will probably have more ideas than you can possibly use–so how do you prioritize the list of machine learning projects? How do you select what to work on? What delivers the greatest ROI? Shipping any machine learning system requires a huge mountain of organizational and data engineering effort, so the ultimate payoff needs to match that investment.</p>\n",
      "<p>The buzz around AI has encouraged many people to think that AI can suddenly double or triple your profitability. That’s unlikely to be true–but what is likely? A product manager needs to be realistic about expectations. You shouldn’t over-promise, and you shouldn’t under-deliver. But neither should you under-promise: while simple products might help you to get started, you want to show upper management you can move the needle significantly. If the needle doesn’t move, you will undermine your team. If a product is feasible, if it’s something customers want, if you can get realistic error rates, and if you understand the development flows, you still have to ask whether it’s the best investment of time and resources. Is there another product that will generate a greater return more quickly?</p>\n",
      "<p>To make these judgements, an AI product manager needs to understand the company’s data inside and out. That includes the ability to do your own analysis, to run SQL queries, to develop metrics, and to build dashboards. If you don’t understand your data intimately, you will have trouble knowing what’s feasible and what isn’t. You will have trouble understanding problems with data quality–you should know in your bones why 80% of a data scientist’s time is spent cleaning data. Without this data familiarity, you will have trouble spotting ethical problems that arise from biased or insufficient data. If you can’t define the right metrics to monitor, you won’t know whether or not your product is successful, nor will you know when your model performance has degraded (as it almost inevitably will).</p>\n",
      "<p>Even if a product is feasible, that’s not the same as product-market fit. Is the product something that customers need? Will it help a small segment of customers or will it increase the most important metric for the majority of your users? Too many companies focus on building something cool without thinking about whether anyone really cares. Customers want you to solve their problems; they don’t care what kind of neural network you’re using. You may discover that you don’t need AI at all, and that’s just fine.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Prioritizing with the business in mind</h2>\n",
      "<p>There are a <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-ways-to-prioritize-a-list-of-product-features/answer/Adam-Nash\">number</a> of <a href=\"https://wavelength.asana.com/workstyle-the-process-and-math-behind-prioritization/\">different</a> <a href=\"https://www.sachinrekhi.com/how-to-prioritize-a-product-roadmap\">ways</a> to prioritize features into a product roadmap, and it&#8217;s likely your product organization already has its own preferred methodology for this. That said, there are many new machine learning teams working on a large number of projects without a clear prioritization or roadmap. Many companies invest a lot in hiring data scientists and building ML platforms, but then they focus them on solving the wrong problems.</p>\n",
      "<p>One successful approach to this issue is to organize ML product feature ideas by theme and concentrate on a few high ROI projects. To prioritize, start with your company’s mission and near-term strategic objectives. What is the business trying to achieve? Pair a machine learning application directly to one of those objectives, so that when you improve the accuracy metric for your model it directly impacts metrics the business cares about. Build a direct connection between your machine learning application and something the company values.</p>\n",
      "<p>For example, at LinkedIn (where co-author Pete Skomoroch previously worked) the mission was to connect the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful. A strategic objective for the company was to become the professional profile of record and have complete and up-to-date resume data in the LinkedIn profiles for all professionals. A project idea under this objective was to create a machine learning model to <a href=\"https://engineering.linkedin.com/research/2014/linkedin-skills-large-scale-topic-extraction-and-inference\">recommend skills</a> a member should add to their profile. A team came up with an impact estimate for the product feature by estimating the expected increase in conversion rate when users were shown ML recommendations.</p>\n",
      "<p><a href=\"https://engineering.linkedin.com/teams/data/artificial-intelligence/people-you-may-know\">People You May Know</a> (PYMK) was a successful example of this type of strategic alignment from LinkedIn&#8217;s data team. The PYMK recommendation system was trained on data including existing LinkedIn connections, profile similarity, and contacts imported from email to suggest other members a user should connect with. PYMK directly paired what the company wanted to do (drive connections) with a machine learning solution. With a small number of engineers, the data team built a production machine learning model that directly improved the most important metric for the company. Within months it also drove new user growth for the site and created a flywheel of user growth that was critical as LinkedIn became a public company.</p>\n",
      "<p>Once you prune down the set of ideas to ones that align with strategic objectives, there are a number of ways to prioritize them. One effective approach is to get everyone in a room who will be building the system, and have the group form consensus estimates of difficulty, headcount, and impact for each project. Then you can create a chart of impact and ease, rank each project by return on investment and prioritize accordingly. In reality, prioritization is a messy and fluid process, as projects often have dependencies and face staffing limitations or conflicts with other stakeholder deadlines. Scope often needs to be reduced or <a href=\"https://randsinrepose.com/archives/bits-features-and-truth/\">quality sacrificed</a> to align with other teams or priorities.</p>\n",
      "<p>Working on something that matters to the business is not the only important criteria to consider, since without access to data, your ML system will be useless. In larger companies, it’s best to start by focusing on business units that are eager to work with you and where your help is needed. When you begin development of your first ML product, try to work with teams that already have training data available and help them drive their most important metric. Ideally, that also aligns with the larger set of company priorities.</p>\n",

This is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out\">garbage in, garbage out</a> principle: flawed data going in leads to flawed results, algorithms, and business decisions. If a self-driving car’s decision-making algorithm is trained on data of traffic collected during the day, you wouldn’t put it on the roads at night. To take it a step further, if such an algorithm is trained in an environment with cars driven by humans, how can you expect it to perform well on roads with other self-driving cars? Beyond the autonomous driving example described, the &#8220;garbage in&#8221; side of the equation can take many forms—for example, incorrectly entered data, poorly packaged data, and data collected incorrectly, more of which we’ll address below.</p>\n",

      "<p>Why is high-quality and accessible data foundational? If you’re basing business decisions on dashboards or the results of online experiments, you need to have the right data. On the machine learning side, we are entering what Andrei Karpathy, director of AI at Tesla, dubs the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35\">Software 2.0</a> era, a new paradigm for software where machine learning and AI require less focus on writing code and more on configuring, selecting inputs, and iterating through data to create higher level models that learn from the data we give them.

Re-analyzing existing data is often very bad.&#8221; John is drawing attention to thinking carefully about what you hope to get out of the data, what question you hope to answer, what biases may exist, and what you need to correct before jumping in with an analysis<a href=\"#_ftn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. With the right mindset, you can get a lot out of analyzing existing data—for example, descriptive data is often quite useful for early-stage companies<a href=\"#_ftn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"F3\">Not too long ago, &#8220;save everything&#8221; was a common maxim in tech; you never knew if you might need the data. However, attempting to repurpose pre-existing data can muddy the water by shifting the semantics from why the data was collected to the question you hope to answer. In particular, determining causation from correlation can be difficult. For example, a pre-existing correlation pulled from an organization’s database should be tested in a new experiment and not assumed to imply causation<a href=\"#_ftn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, instead of this commonly encountered pattern in tech:</p>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>A large fraction of users that do X do Z</li>\n",
      "<li>Z is good</li>\n",
      "<li>Let&#8217;s get everybody to do X</li>\n",
      "</ol>\n",
      "<p>Correlation in existing data is evidence for causation that then needs to be verified by collecting more data.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"F4\">The same challenge plagues scientific research. Take the case of Brian Wansink, former head of the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University, who stepped down after <a href=\"http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2018/09/provost-issues-statement-wansink-academic-misconduct-investigation\">a Cornell faculty review reported</a> he &#8220;committed academic misconduct in his research and scholarship, including misreporting of research data, problematic statistical techniques [and] failure to properly document and preserve research results.&#8221; One of his more egregious errors was to continually test already collected data for new hypotheses until one stuck, after his initial hypothesis failed<a href=\"#_ftn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/09/26/651849441/cornell-food-researchers-downfall-raises-larger-questions-for-science\">NPR put it well</a>: &#8220;the gold standard of scientific studies is to make a single hypothesis, gather data to test it, and analyze the results to see if it holds up. By Wansink&#8217;s own admission in the blog post, that&#8217;s not what happened in his lab.&#8221; He continually tried to fit new hypotheses unrelated to why he collected the data until he got a null hypothesis with an acceptable p-value—a perversion of the scientific method.</p>\n",

      "<h2>The importance of automating data preparation</h2>\n",
      "<p>Most of the conversation around AI automation involves automating machine learning models, a field known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_machine_learning\">AutoML</a>. This is important: consider how many modern models need to operate at scale and in real time (such as Google’s search engine and the relevant tweets that Twitter surfaces in your feed). We also need to be talking about automation of all steps in the data science workflow/pipeline, including those at the start. Why is it important to automate data preparation?</p>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>It occupies an inordinate amount of time for data professionals. Data drudgery automation in the era of <a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/definition/28093/data-smog\">data smog</a> will free data scientists up for doing more interesting, creative work (such as modeling or interfacing with business questions and insights). &#8220;76% of data scientists view data preparation as the least enjoyable part of their work,&#8221; according to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/03/23/data-preparation-most-time-consuming-least-enjoyable-data-science-task-survey-says/#747151796f63\">a CrowdFlower survey</a>.</li>\n",
      "<li id=\"F6\"><span id=\"F7\"></span>A series of subjective data preparation micro-decisions can bias your analysis. For example, one analyst may throw out data with missing values, another may infer the missing values. For more on how micro-decisions in analysis can impact results, I recommend <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917747646\"><em>Many Analysts, One Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect Results</em></a><a href=\"#_ftn6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> (note that the analytical micro-decisions in this study are not only data preparation decisions). Automating data preparation won’t necessarily remove such bias, but it will make it systematic, discoverable, auditable, unit-testable, and correctable. Model results will then be less reliant on individuals making hundreds of micro-decisions. An added benefit is that the work will be reproducible and robust, in the sense that somebody else (say, in another department) can reproduce the analysis and get the same results<a href=\"#_ftn7\"><sup>[7]</sup></a>;</li>\n",
      "<li>For the increasing number of real-time algorithms in production, humans need to be taken out of the loop at runtime as much as possible (and perhaps be kept in the loop more as <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/01/algorithms-need-managers-too\">algorithmic managers</a>): when you use Siri to make a reservation on OpenTable by asking for a table for four at a nearby Italian restaurant tonight, there’s a speech-to-text model, a geographic search model, and a restaurant-matching model, all working together in real time. No data analysts/scientists work on this data pipeline as everything must happen in real time, requiring an automated data preparation and data quality workflow (e.g., to resolve if I say &#8220;eye-talian&#8221; instead of &#8220;it-atian&#8221;).</li>\n",
      "</ol>\n",
      "<p>The third point above speaks more generally to the need for automation around all parts of the data science workflow. This need will grow as smart devices, IoT, voice assistants, drones, and augmented and virtual reality become more prevalent.</p>\n",

      "<p id=\"F8\"><span id=\"F9\"></span>Understanding the importance of general automation and democratization of all parts of the DS/ML/AI workflow, it’s important to recognize that we’ve done pretty well at democratizing data collection and gathering, modeling<a href=\"#_ftn8\"><sup>[8]</sup></a>, and data reporting<a href=\"#_ftn9\"><sup>[9]</sup></a>, but what remains stubbornly difficult is the whole process of preparing the data.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Modern tools for automating data cleaning and data preparation</h2>\n",
      "<p>We’re seeing the emergence of modern tools for automated data cleaning and preparation, such as <a href=\"https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/blog/holoclean.html\">HoloClean</a> and <a href=\"https://www.snorkel.org/\">Snorkel</a> coming from <a href=\"https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/\">Christopher Ré’s group at Stanford</a>. HoloClean decouples the task of data cleaning into error detection (such as recognizing that the location &#8220;cicago&#8221; is erroneous) and repairing erroneous data (such as changing &#8220;cicago&#8221; to &#8220;Chicago&#8221;), and formalizes the fact that &#8220;data cleaning is a statistical learning and inference problem.&#8221; All data analysis and data science work is a combination of data, assumptions, and prior knowledge. So when you’re missing data or have &#8220;low-quality data,&#8221; you use assumptions, statistics, and inference to repair your data. HoloClean performs this automatically in a principled, statistical manner. All the user needs to do is &#8220;to specify high-level assertions that capture their domain expertise with respect to invariants that the input data needs to satisfy. No other supervision is required!&#8221;</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"F10\">The HoloClean team also has a system for automating the &#8220;building and managing [of] training datasets without manual labeling&#8221; called Snorkel. Having correctly labeled data is a key part of preparing data to build machine learning models<a href=\"#_ftn10\"><sup>[10]</sup></a>. As more and more data is generated, manually labeling it is unfeasible. Snorkel provides a way to automate labeling, using a modern paradigm called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723\">data programming</a>, in which users are able to &#8220;inject domain information [or heuristics] into machine learning models in higher level, higher bandwidth ways than manually labeling thousands or millions of individual data points.&#8221; <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/03/harnessing-organizational-knowledge-for.html\">Researchers at Google AI</a> have adapted Snorkel to label data at industrial/web scale and demonstrated its utility in three scenarios: topic classification, product classification, and real-time event classification.</p>\n",
      "<p>Snorkel doesn’t stop at data labeling. It also allows you to automate two other key aspects of data preparation:</p>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li>Data augmentation—that is, creating more labeled data. Consider an image recognition problem in which you are trying to detect cars in photos for your self-driving car algorithm. Classically, you’ll need at least several thousand labeled photos for your training dataset. If you don’t have enough training data and it’s too expensive to manually collect and label more data, you can create more by rotating and reflecting your images.</li>\n",
      "<li>Discovery of critical data subsets—for example, figuring out which subsets of your data really help to distinguish spam from non-spam.</li>\n",
      "</ol>\n",
      "<p>These are two of many current examples of the augmented data preparation revolution, which includes products from <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SS3RA7_15.0.0/com.ibm.spss.modeler.help/idh_idd_adp_objective.htm\">IBM</a> and <a href=\"https://www.datarobot.com/webinar/minimizing-model-risk-automated-data-preparation-machine-learning/\">DataRobot</a>.</p>\n",
      "<h2>The future of data tooling and data preparation as a cultural challenge</h2>\n",
      "<p>So what does the future hold? In a world with an increasing number of models and algorithms in production, learning from large amounts of real-time streaming data, we need both education and tooling/products for domain experts to build, interact with, and audit the relevant data pipelines.</p>\n",
      "<p>We’ve seen a lot of headway made in democratizing and automating data collection and building models. Just look at the emergence of drag-and-drop tools for machine learning workflows coming out of <a href=\"https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/01/google-automl-makes-adding-ai-as-simple-as-drag-and-drop.html\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/microsoft-launches-a-drag-and-drop-machine-learning-tool-and-hosted-jupyter-notebooks/\">Microsoft</a>. As we saw from the recent O’Reilly survey, data preparation and cleaning still take up a lot of time that data professionals don’t enjoy. For this reason, it’s exciting that we’re now starting to see headway in automated tooling for data cleaning and preparation. It will be interesting to see how this space grows and how the tools are adopted.</p>\n",
      "<p>A bright future would see data preparation and data quality as first-class citizens in the data workflow, alongside machine learning, deep learning, and AI. Dealing with incorrect or missing data is unglamorous but necessary work. It’s easy to justify working with data that’s obviously wrong; the only real surprise is the amount of time it takes. Understanding how to manage more subtle problems with data, such as data that reflects and perpetuates historical biases (for example, real estate redlining) is a more difficult organizational challenge. This will require honest, open conversations in any organization around what data workflows actually look like.</p>\n",
      "<p>The fact that business leaders are focused on predictive models and deep learning while data workers spend most of their time on data preparation is a cultural challenge, not a technical one. If this part of the data flow pipeline is going to be solved in the future, everybody needs to acknowledge and understand the challenge.</p>\n",

Under his leadership, Assurant Solutions doubled in size to $4B, underwent a digital transformation to expand an offering of risk management solutions in the connected living space, and became established in 25 new markets around the world. After Lemasters left Assurant, he bought a company called GXG where, as the chief executive officer, he focuses on accelerating the growth of companies through rapid-cycle learning.

      "<p>Below, you’ll find notable themes that emerged during the discussions. You can see the full interviews <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/tag/big-systemic-thinking/\">here</a>.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Continuous learning and continuous improvement</h2>\n",
      "<p>When people ask Craig Lemasters how long he ran Assurant Solutions, he says 44 quarters rather than 11 years.</p>\n",
      "<p>“That’s how we think,” he said. “How do you free up time to think beyond a quarter or two or a year or two? We can do that. We can get to that place.”</p>\n",
      "<p>But when Assurant’s distribution model—big box retailers—started collapsing, Lemasters wondered how he would shape the company’s future while focusing on the short term.</p>\n",
      "<p>He knew it started with him as a CEO, but he didn’t know that other “lonely CEOs” were stuck in the same place. He engaged GXG (a company he later purchased) to help him over the hurdle by exposing him to the wisdom of others who navigated the same path. Continuous learning, especially from others who have developed wisdom from being in the same position, helps leaders get unstuck and become more agile.</p>\n",
      "<p>Continuous learning is also required to understand the relationship between humanity and technology.</p>\n",
      "<p>“Technology is driving and enabling at the same time,” Dana Codispoti said. “It’s a matter of how we use it. We need the human mind.”</p>\n",
      "<p>From an HR perspective, Codispoti said, we need to go faster to get our minds ready. Companies should understand, among other things, the power of robotics and AI, along with the art of the possible, “while they are fixing the foundation,” Codispoti said. Too often, companies try to grasp at the next big thing without laying the foundation for learning first.</p>\n",
      "<p>“There’s a whole world of things to learn,” Codispoti said. “I look at it as an enabler.”</p>\n",
      "<p>Jen Bruno agreed. “Every business professional should consider themselves a continuous learner,” Bruno said. She noted that people need to be “change ready,”and get better at applying what they know in different areas for the greater good. Every company should get employees excited and engaged to learn because change keeps happening “faster than we can imagine.”</p>\n",
      "<p>What makes a company a world-class learning organization?</p>\n",
      "<p>“When people truly are in a mindset of continuous improvement,” Bruno said. “We can learn something from every person we meet. That’s good for business. Share talent and knowledge, and foster collaboration for greater outcomes.”</p>\n",
      "<h2>Business lessons from technology processes</h2>\n",
      "<p>Companies need a clear vision in a complex world, Codispoti said. “Create a north star that people can align to, that gets people excited about solving a problem,” she said. “Without it, they spin and spin and spin. If people don’t know how their work is value-add, you lose engagement. It ties to the enterprise vision.”</p>\n",
      "<p>As more companies shift to Agile software development and, more importantly, an Agile mindset, the culture of companies has begun to mimic the iterative nature of technology. Smaller, granular pieces need to communicate with each other in the most effective way. This is true for microservices architecture, for example, and for people across teams.</p>\n",
      "<p>Codispoti said that creating a process requires an end-to-end vision, but silos often lead to fragments being created piecemeal. “Once [a broken process] is enabled through technology and you want to make changes, it’s hard and people blame the technology,” Codispoti said.</p>\n",
      "<p>Huge problems, James Jorasch said, need to be “distilled down to something that a client can understand and take action on.” Science House works with large enterprise clients, often on transformational software projects that can span years. The parallel between technology and people applies here, too.&nbsp; Making complex projects and transformations more modular creates a parallel impact on people and organizational structures, changing the nature of their responsibilities and spans of control. Bringing modular pieces together, whether the modules are temporal or functional, changes the role of traditional hierarchical organizational structures as they adapt to increased complexity.</p>\n",
      "<p>“The nature of management is changing, and not just because of Agile,” Jorasch said. “It’s a different way of thinking. Managers have gone from managing people to managing processes, mindsets, skills, and problems.”</p>\n",
      "<p>They also need to manage information flow into and from these groups.</p>\n",
      "<p>“There are lessons learned from tech that will be applicable to people,” Jorasch said. “Where are the bottlenecks? What are the styles of thinking you need? Focus on what’s essential. How do you get the right information to the right person at the right time?”</p>\n",
      "<h2>Humility is an asset</h2>\n",
      "<p>One of the themes that came throughout the interviews was the need for humility. Without it, companies tend to stay inward looking and siloed.</p>\n",
      "<p>“Companies struggle with cross-collaboration,” Codispoti said. “People tend to work in silos. They need to partner with experts in other areas. They don’t need to do it on their own, and they’re missing opportunities.”</p>\n",
      "<p>Bruno and Lemasters both cited humility as a critical trait for leaders. Humility gives people the energy to cross over into an unfamiliar area, Bruno said, and creates the capacity for empathy.</p>\n",
      "<p>“I look for the humility quotient,” Lemasters said. “A willingness for leaders to embrace outside thinking and ideas. Some would call it criticism, but it isn’t. Have the humility to accept people who have wisdom in their swim lanes. We learn quickly. There’s goodness in humanity, and people want to help.”</p>\n",
      "<p>Jorasch often cites the need for not taking ourselves too seriously during innovation sessions, for example, because one person’s silly or half-formed comment gives another person a great idea. Humility helps prevent people from having to project authority or expertise every time they speak. With humility comes better listening; more honest, authentic input; less defensiveness; and more collaboration based on respect for one’s peers’ opinions.</p>\n",

      "<p>Rita J. King, co-director and EVP for business development at Science House, recently conducted a series of interviews with business leaders, exploring the challenges and hurdles companies face in evolving business landscapes. In this interview, King chats with Dana Codispoti, head of HR Transformation at AIG, about how to address the human factor in business transformations to keep employees engaged and connected to the overall business mission. They also discuss the future of the human-technology relationship and why technology should be viewed as an enabler rather than a replacement for human contributions.</p>\n",
      "<p>Here are some highlights from their conversation:</p>\n",
      "<p>With technology iterating and improving at ever-increasing speeds, companies are challenged with how best to utilize data and analytics to inform new technology decisions. Codispoti stresses that it&#8217;s imperative to start with the foundation, the &#8220;building blocks,&#8221; and not jump straight to the innovation or &#8220;shiny object.&#8221; The key, Codispoti notes, to successfully navigating new technologies and processes lies with the people and their engagement with the company&#8217;s overall vision. &#8220;One of the most important things you need to do in technology initiatives,&#8221; she says, &#8220;is to create a vision to help people understand what they are driving toward. I see a lot of work being done in the trenches where people don&#8217;t see the bigger picture—everybody&#8217;s working on an individual project or set of projects, but they can&#8217;t understand how it fits into a broader picture. If there isn&#8217;t a vision for the company, create one, or create a North Star that people can align to. That gets people excited about a problem; it gets people excited about participating in the solution. &#8230; If people don&#8217;t know why their work is value add and how it ties to a broader picture, you lose engagement.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=118\">01:58</a>)</p>\n",
      "<p>Mitigating risk is a hurdle for any company facing changing technology and business processes. Codispoti says the solution lies in breaking out of silos and comfort zones to leverage the expertise of colleagues across an organization. &#8220;I find companies struggle with cross collaboration,&#8221; She explains. &#8220;If someone&#8217;s, for example, working in a business, they need to leverage their partners. In my case, it would be HR, finance, the risk organization, the audit, and legal folks. I think people tend to work in silos, and they need to lift up their heads, look around and say, these people are experts in those areas. Talk through and partner with them to understand the problems they&#8217;re solving for so that they can help point out the risk. People think they need to do all that on their own, and they&#8217;re missing opportunities to mitigate risk. &#8230; It&#8217;s about breaking through silos and pointing out how collaboration is additive—when you work in teams, you get more. People also have a mindset that &#8216;I need to fix this for my area,&#8217; and it&#8217;s not an enterprise mentality. As you go through these transformations, it&#8217;s about trying to influence the culture to say you wear two hats: one is for whatever you&#8217;re working on and one is for the enterprise, and lead with that enterprise mindset.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=328\">05:28</a>)</p>\n",
      "<p>Looking toward the future and humanity&#8217;s evolving relationship with technology, Codispoti stresses that machines will always need people and humans should not fear being replaced. &#8220;There&#8217;s a large level of awareness around technology driving the future in a lot of ways, but I think there&#8217;s also fear that technology is going to take over humanity—we know that&#8217;s not the case,&#8221; She says. &#8220;You need both. &#8230; At the end of the day, the work is in the work, in the process, in the culture, in the people, and then technology becomes an enabler. So, it&#8217;s driving and enabling at the same time, but I think everybody needs to co-exist. Nobody&#8217;s going to be wiped out by technology; it&#8217;s a matter of how we use it and we recognize that it can do things faster than we can, but in some ways we need the human mind to enhance whatever technology is doing.&#8221;(<a href=\"#t=880\">14:40</a>)</p>\n",

      "<p>Rita J. King, co-director and EVP for business development at Science House, recently conducted a series of interviews with business leaders, exploring the challenges and hurdles companies face in evolving business landscapes. In this interview, King chats with Jen Bruno, SVP of culture and human capital at LPL Financial, about mobilizing a change-ready workforce, leadership rotation programs, and fostering continuous learning.</p>\n",
      "<p>Here are some highlights from their conversation:</p>\n",
      "<p>The reality, Bruno argues, is that businesses are in a state of change. And while humans tend to have a hard time with change, the time is ripe for people to take advantage of the coming changes to grow and develop. &#8220;Companies have a hard time mobilizing a workforce that is change-ready because people inherently want to do what they know; we build our careers on the skills that have allowed us to move to the next level. We&#8217;re at a time right now where people can look beyond that and use those skills in another department or a new area; crossing over can enable the imagination, the creativity, and the innovation that companies so desperately want in order to grow and best serve their customers. It&#8217;s an exciting opportunity for people to think of themselves as change agents and be willing to crossover and work in different areas, leveraging what they know and learning what they don&#8217;t know. (<a href=\"#t=383\">06:23</a>)</p>\n",
      "<p>Bridging culture gaps—and communication gaps— between departments is essential, Bruno says, to enable teams to work together efficiently and effectively to reap better outcomes. Creating these working relationship bridges, she argues, starts at the top. &#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan of having leaders rotate through the different jobs within an organization. The true way to learn empathy is to do the work yourself and understand what the people in specific roles go through on a day-to-day business. You&#8217;ll have a better understanding of the business operation as a whole. I think it makes you a better business leader because it does help develop that empathy, and it allows you to build your network of people internally, and that&#8217;s really important too.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=656\">10:56</a>)</p>\n",
      "<p>The key to weathering the transition to what work will become in the future, Bruno argues, is continuous learning. &#8220;Every business professional should consider themselves a continuous learner. There is so much to learn from other organizations that have similar situations, from business people we have things in common with, and it&#8217;s important to be change-ready and willing to leverage what you know in different areas for the greater good. We should all be preparing ourselves as much as we can so we can bring value to the companies we work for, whatever that might look like.&#8221; To that end, it&#8217;s important for learning and development approaches to evolve, she says, to be more effective in the face of the changes coming our way. &#8220;I hope I never see a PowerPoint presentation being held up in a room for an hour while somebody talks to an audience, because that&#8217;s not really fostering learning in a way that gets people excited and engaged.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=839\">13:59</a>)</p>\n",

      "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/Uz6cibmqT1I/\n",
      "<p>Rita J. King, co-director and EVP for business development at Science House, recently conducted a series of interviews with business leaders, exploring the challenges and hurdles companies face in evolving business landscapes. In this interview, King chats with James Jorasch, founding CEO of Science House, about the importance of innovation and how to inspire and harness the creative talent in your workforce.</p>\n",
      "<p>Here are some highlights from their conversation:</p>\n",
      "<p>It&#8217;s important, Jorasch says, to appropriate the techniques of innovation that bring together ideas from disparate sources and apply those to people in your company. &#8220;We need people also to collide; people with different perspectives, different concepts, different ideas need to come together over and over again.&#8221; He also notes that invention isn&#8217;t only an innate talent; it can also be a learned skill. &#8220;We train many people, and I would say that everyone can invent. Believe in yourself, relax, find a problem, come up with a solution, keep going. It&#8217;s not a complicated thing. Just believe in yourself and try. Trying is probably 90% of it.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=315\">05:15</a>)</p>\n",
      "<p>To effectively get the creative juices flowing, Jorasch recommends ditching large meetings, as they allow people to avoid contributing by simply hiding in the crowd. &#8220;When you bring a meeting down to just two people, there&#8217;s no hiding, there&#8217;s no, &#8216;Well, I&#8217;m going to be on my cell phone. We&#8217;re working on this.&#8217; There&#8217;s no getting away from what you&#8217;re there to do. It is that sense of focus that you get from two people that really ignites the imagination process.&#8221; That focus, he says, is key to addressing the new challenges coming. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot that can be accomplished from creative pairs. It is a purpose driven, very focused way of tackling problems, and tackling very complicated and very deep problems. It takes away everything else—you&#8217;re lasered in on that one thing for, potentially, hours at a time. And that&#8217;s what it takes, right? 10-second solutions are not going to cut it in this world.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=449\">07:29</a>)</p>\n",
      "<p>The data Science House has gathered from large companies over the years has afforded interesting insights into the changing nature of management, Jorasch says. For instance, in our increasingly Agile approaches to business and systems, the well-established, traditional hierarchy of individual contributor, manager, director, VP, SVP, and so forth, is no longer a great fit. &#8220;We have rules around the standard hierarchy,&#8221; he observes. &#8220;We don&#8217;t really have rules, per se, around Agile. And we&#8217;re seeing a collision of managers and directors now saying, &#8216;I&#8217;ve been a director for 15 years—what&#8217;s my role now with these Agile teams?&#8217; People are starting to question what it is they&#8217;re supposed to do.&#8221; And it&#8217;s not only evolving cultures and approaches challenging leaders, but evolving technologies, too. &#8220;The idea of using microservices, for example, is a very different way of thinking,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;Those managers and directors and VPs are evolving from managing people to managing a process or managing mindsets and skills of the workers, and managing problems or managing the information flow into these groups. That&#8217;s going to require a very different set of skills and new types of training.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=790\">13:10</a>)</p>\n",

      "\n",
      "<p>&#8220;Digital transformation&#8221; means something different to every company. The key to successfully traversing the transformation, Lemasters explains, is to identify specifically what it means to a particular company. In his case, he was running a global insurance company called Assurance Solutions, and he identified two specific areas of focus: &#8220;we knew we needed to have a digital relationship with the end consumer. &#8230; [And] we knew we needed to have some type of digital distribution model.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=153\">02:33</a>)</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>To succeed in a new space, Lemasters came to realize, requires both knowledge and experience—an intersection Lemasters uses to define &#8220;wisdom.&#8221; This realization led to Lemasters&#8217; big &#8220;ah-ha!&#8221; moment: &#8220;The stumbling block for digital was, quite frankly, that we didn&#8217;t have either knowledge or experience on digital, and it started with me. I mean, it started with me even as a CEO. I started looking at my team and realized none of us really had a lot of knowledge and experience on this thing called digital. The whole &#8220;ah-ha&#8221; experience was that speed bump. What if we inserted knowledge and experience into the room—could we get to the point much quicker? That&#8217;s what&#8217;s become my passion &#8212; how do we interject this thing called wisdom into the conversation, into the process, just to get us there faster?&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=340\">05:40</a>)</p>\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<p>Lemasters argues that humility is key to being a strong, agile leader. Being able to make decisions at the rate of speed required today takes, if not a village, at least <em>some</em> additional expertise. &#8220;The &#8216;humility quotient&#8217; is the willingness for leaders to literally embrace outside thinking,&#8221; Lemasters explained. &#8220;Some would call it criticism; it really isn&#8217;t. I mean, most of this work is about the unknown, and you just haven&#8217;t been there yet. What I found is if we just have enough humility to accept that and actually invite in some people who have the wisdom in these swim lanes, increasing the speed at which we learn, we get over ourselves pretty quickly.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=676\">11:16</a>)</p>\n",

      "<p>One example is <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf\">reinforcement learning</a>, which experienced an exponential spike in usage on the O’Reilly platform in 2018—growing by 1,612%—before regressing slightly (-5%) in 2019 (see Figure 1).</p>\n",
      "<p>Looking at AI/ML topic detail, we see usage in neural networks continuing its upward trend—up 52% in 2018; up 17% in 2019—but the related topic of deep learning dropped 10% in 2019. The drop in deep learning seems likely a function of inter-year noise and not evidence of an emerging trend, given the significant usage growth in 2018 (+52%). These closely related topics are popular: aggregating neural networks, deep learning, and TensorFlow usage nets nearly half (47%) of all AI/ML category usage, showing a slight decline (-3%) in 2019 after growing 24% in 2018.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"F4\">In our “<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise-2020/\">AI adoption in the enterprise 2020</a>” survey, we found that deep learning was the most popular ML method among companies that are evaluating AI. Among companies using AI to support production use cases, deep learning was No. 2<a href=\"#_ftn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. It might be that—at 1% of platform usage and 22% of all AI/ML usage—deep learning has approached its asymptote. Growth could be slow from here on out.</p>\n",
      "<h2>The rising AI/ML tide lifts (almost) all boats</h2>\n",
      "<p>Another topic showing consistent growth is natural language processing (NLP) (see Figure 1). Its growth rate isn’t spectacular—+15% in 2018, +9% in 2019—but NLP now accounts for about 12% of all AI/ML usage on O&#8217;Reilly. That’s about 6x the share of unsupervised learning and 5x the share of reinforcement learning usage.</p>\n",
      "<p>Interest in some methods or applications of ML seems to be waning, however. For example, the chatbots topic continues to decline, first by 17% in 2018 and by 34% in 2019. This is probably a reflection of the comparative maturity of the space. The chatbot was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot#Development\">one of the first applications of AI</a> in experimental and production usage. This likely doesn’t portend the end of interactions with occasionally helpful—and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/21/technology/conversational-bots.html\">still sometimes horrifying</a>—customer service chatbots.</p>\n",
      "<p>Computer vision usage shows a slow decline, falling by 3% in 2018 and 2% in 2019. Probably more noise than trend, moreover, computer vision accounts for about twice as much usage activity as the fast growing unsupervised learning topic.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Python-based tools are ascendant in AI/ML</h2>\n",
      "<p>Reports of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torch_(machine_learning)\">Torch’s</a> death are <a href=\"https://github.com/torch/torch7\">somewhat misleading</a>. In fact, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyTorch\">PyTorch</a>—a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern\">wrapper</a> that permits users to call Torch’s ML libraries from Python—posted triple-digit growth in usage in just the last few years, surging by almost 400% in 2018 and by 111% in 2019 (see Figure 1). PyTorch’s popularity is probably a function of the success of Python itself, particularly for ML and AI: vanilla Torch uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)\">Lua</a> as a wrapper to expose its core C libraries; PyTorch eschews Lua (in favor of Python) for the same purpose.</p>\n",
      "<p>Once you factor <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/oreilly-2020-platform-analysis/\">in the preeminence of Python</a>, the rising popularity of PyTorch <a href=\"https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2019/4\">makes a lot of sense</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"F5\">This may have something to do with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow\">TensorFlow</a>’s outsized presence in ML, too. In 2019, it accounted for 1% of all usage, about a third as much usage as machine learning and 22% of all AI/ML usage. TensorFlow isn’t a Python-exclusive technology—it exposes stable C <em>and</em> Python APIs<a href=\"#_ftn5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a>—but its users tend to be Python-savvy and its related projects, patterns, tutorials, etc., disproportionately involve Python.</p>\n",
      "<p id=\"F6\">The results of our recent <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise-2020/\">AI adoption survey</a> underscore this trend. TensorFlow was also the No. 1 ML technology in the survey, while PyTorch came in at No. 4. Two additional Python-based tools (<a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\">scikit-learn</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras\">Keras</a>) also cracked the top five<a href=\"#_ftn6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.

The prominence of these and other Python-related tools attests to this fact.</p>\n",
      "<h2>What’s in a name? The shift to “artificial intelligence”</h2>\n",
      "<p>Does the growing engagement in neural networks, reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and the increased focus on putting models into production augur a shift in how practitioners in the space frame what they do? We think yes, with practitioners increasingly calling their work “artificial intelligence”—a notion supported by the growth in AI usage on O’Reilly, the increasing embrace of sophisticated tools, and the empirical trend of putting those tools into production, which we see in our AI surveys.</p>\n",
      "<p>AI has always been the general term for building intelligent systems, with machine learning covering the more specific case of building software that learns and modifies its outputs without the need for additional coding. Here are some examples of what, when viewed in aggregate, helps explain why those in the space think machine learning doesn’t quite cover all they do:</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>Machine learning produces models that are widely used in the automation of tasks such as credit scoring, fraud detection, recommendation engines, etc., but ML models are increasingly deployed in libraries or services and exposed via APIs—such that a model or ensemble of models can be invoked by any valid user, program, or service.</li>\n",
      "<li>To some extent, models can be built with an aim toward reuse, such that, for example, a data profiling model can be invoked and used to support different business use cases.</li>\n",
      "<li>Tools and techniques like reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning open up new use cases, including decision support, interactive games, real-time retail recommendation engines, and data discovery.</li>\n",
      "<li>The focus of usage—and, with it, design and development—is shifting from the specific to the generalized. ML libraries and services have the potential to transform the software products we deliver, the processes that consume them, and—concomitant with this—the experiences of users, customers, partners, etc., alike.</li>\n",
      "<li>This isn’t <em>just</em> ML; it’s a kind of AI: a new way of thinking about and applying machine intelligence. It has implications for software architecture, infrastructure, and operations—for virtually all domains.</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<p>So, this isn’t <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence\">artificial general intelligence</a>, but AI as the application of machine learning to solve problems, increase productivity, accelerate processes, and in many cases deliver wholly new products and services.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>\n",
      "<p>As organizations adopt analytic technologies, they’re discovering more about themselves and their worlds. Adoption of ML, especially, prompts people at all levels of an organization to start asking questions that challenge in different ways what the organization <a href=\"https://www.eckerson.com/articles/the-data-modeling-conundrum-do-you-create-a-model-from-the-real-or-the-ideal\">thinks it knows about itself</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p>An organization’s use of ML tools and techniques, and the contexts in which it uses them, will tend to change, too. For example, the techniques of supervised learning are useful for classifying known-knowns and for elucidating certain kinds of known-unknowns; they’re unsuitable for surfacing <a href=\"https://scet.berkeley.edu/artificial-intelligence-and-the-rumsfeld-test/\">unknown-unknowns</a>, however. Unsupervised techniques are better for this. Not for classifying, synthesizing, or <em>understanding</em> unknown-unknowns—that’s the responsibility of human intelligence—but for <em>surfacing them in the first place</em>. The upshot is that adopters are integrating <em>both</em> kinds of learning into their ML practices. They’re also apt to experiment with advanced ML methods—such as deep learning—that have applications for both supervised and unsupervised learning. In fact, we found in our AI adoption survey that those new to ML are almost as likely to experiment with deep learning as mature adopters.</p>\n",
      "<p>Right now, companies are successfully using ML to ferret out known-unknowns and unknown-unknowns in their business worlds. They’re instantiating what they discover, analyze, and understand about their worlds in models. Some are also starting to incorporate these models into automated, quasi-intelligent products, services, and software. All of this partakes of the propulsive logic of self-discovery. It’s at the root of a question Plato first formulated almost 2,500 years ago: “But how will you look for something when you don’t in the least know what it is?” he has Meno ask Socrates. “How on earth are you going to set up something you don’t know as the object of your search?”</p>\n",
      "<p>Philosophical tradition <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemic-paradoxes/#MenParInqPuzAboGaiKno\">treats this question as a paradox</a>. It’s also possible to see it as an inquiry into how an object of knowledge augments and transforms <em>itself</em>. With ML and AI, we’re training machines to surface new objects of knowledge that help us as we learn to ask new, different, and sometimes difficult questions about ourselves. By all indications, we seem to be having some success with this.</p>\n",

      "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/51j23cc8IHc/\n",
      "<p>Last year, when we felt interest in artificial intelligence (AI) was approaching a fever pitch, we created a survey to ask about AI adoption. When we analyzed the <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">results</a>, we determined the AI space was in a state of rapid change, so we eagerly commissioned a follow-up survey to help find out where AI stands right now. The new survey, which ran for a few weeks in December 2019, generated an enthusiastic 1,388 responses. The update sheds light on what AI adoption looks like in the enterprise— hint: deployments are shifting from prototype to production—the popularity of specific techniques and tools, the challenges experienced by adopters, and so on. There’s a lot to bite into here, so let’s get started.</p>\n",
      "<p>Key survey results:</p>\n",
      "<ul id=\"F1\">\n",
      "<li>The majority (85%) of respondent organizations are evaluating AI or using it in production<a href=\"#_ftn1\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>. Just 15% are not doing anything at all with AI.</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>More than half of respondent organizations identify as “mature” adopters of AI technologies: that is, they’re using AI for analysis or in production.</li>\n",
      "<li>Supervised learning is the most popular ML technique among mature AI adopters, while deep learning is the most popular technique among organizations that are still evaluating AI.</li>\n",
      "<li>Though a problem, the lack of ML and AI skills isn’t the biggest impediment to AI adoption. Almost 22% of respondents identified a lack of institutional support as the most significant issue.</li>\n",
      "<li>Few organizations are using formal governance controls to support their AI efforts.</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<p>The takeaway: AI adoption is proceeding apace. Most companies that were evaluating or experimenting with AI are now using it in production deployments. It’s still early, but companies need to do more to put their AI efforts on solid ground. Whether it’s controlling for common risk factors—bias in model development, missing or poorly conditioned data, the tendency of models to degrade in production—or instantiating formal processes to promote data governance, adopters will have their work cut out for them as they work to establish reliable AI production lines.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Respondent demographics</h2>\n",
      "<p>Survey respondents represent 25 different industries, with “Software” (~17%) as the largest distinct vertical. The sample is far from tech-laden, however: the only other explicit technology category—“Computers, Electronics, &amp; Hardware”—accounts for less than 7% of the sample. The “Other” category (~22%) comprises 12 separate industries.</p>\n",
      "<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Industry of survey respondents\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/1-industry.png\"><figcaption>Figure 1. Industry of survey respondents.</figcaption></figure>\n",
      "<h3>Data scientists dominate, but executives are amply represented</h3>\n",
      "<p>One-sixth of respondents identify as data scientists, but executives—i.e., directors, vice presidents, and CxOs—account for about 26% of the sample. The survey does have a data-laden tilt, however: almost 30% of respondents identify as data scientists, data engineers, AIOps engineers, or as people who manage them. What is more, almost three-quarters of survey respondents say they work with data in their jobs. All told, more than 70% of respondents work in technology roles.</p>\n",
      "<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Role of survey respondents\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/2-role.png\"><figcaption>Figure 2. Role of survey respondents.</figcaption></figure>\n",
      "<h3>Regional breakdown</h3>\n",
      "<p>Close to 50% of respondents work in North America, most of them in the United States, which by itself is home to almost 40% of survey participants. Western Europe (~23%) was the next largest region, followed by Asia at 15%. Participants from South America, Eastern Europe, Oceania, and Africa account for roughly 15% of responses.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Analysis: The state of AI adoption today</h2>\n",
      "<p id=\"F2\">More than half of respondent organizations are in the “mature” phase of AI adoption (using AI for analysis/production), while about one-third are still evaluating AI<a href=\"#_ftn2\"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>. This is close to a mirror image of <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">last year’s AI survey results</a>, when 54% of respondent organizations were evaluating AI and just 27% were in the “mature” adoption phase. This year, about 15% of respondent organizations are not doing anything with AI, down ~20% from our 2019 survey.</p>\n",
      "<p>The upshot is that 85% of organizations are using AI, and (of these) most are using it in production. It seems as if the experimental AI projects of 2019 have borne fruit. But what kind?</p>\n",
      "<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Where AI projects are being used within companies\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/3-functional-parts-of-companies.png\"><figcaption>Figure 3. Where AI projects are being used within companies.</figcaption></figure>\n",
      "<p>The bulk of AI use is in research and development—cited by just under half of all respondents—followed by IT, which was cited by just over one-third. (Respondents were encouraged to make multiple selections.) Another high-use functional area is customer service, with just under 30% of share. Two functional areas—marketing/advertising/PR and operations/facilities/fleet management—see usage share of about 20%. Clearly respondent organizations see the value of AI in a raft of different functional organizations, and the flat results from last year show a consistency to that pattern.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Common challenges to AI adoption</h2>\n",
      "<p>The acquisition and retention of AI-specific skills remains a significant impediment to adoption in most organizations. This year, slightly more than one-sixth of respondents cited difficulty in hiring/retaining people with AI skills as a significant barrier to AI adoption in their organizations. This is down, albeit slightly, from 2019, when 18% of respondents blamed an AI skills gap for lagging adoption.</p>\n",
      "<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Bottlenecks to AI adoption\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/4-bottlenecks.png\"><figcaption>Figure 4. Bottlenecks to AI adoption.</figcaption></figure>\n",
      "<p>Believe it or not, a skills gap isn’t the biggest impediment to AI adoption. In 2020, as in 2019, a plurality of respondents—almost 22%—identified a lack of institutional support as the biggest problem. In both 2019 and 2020, the AI skills gap actually occupied the <em>No. 3</em> slot; this year, it trailed “Difficulties in identifying appropriate business use cases,” which was cited by 20% of respondents.</p>\n",
      "<p>A more detailed look at the bottleneck data shows executives selecting an unsupportive culture less often (15%) than the practitioners and managers (23%) who responded to the survey.</p>\n",
      "<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Bottlenecks to AI adoption with AI maturity level\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/5-bottlenecks-with-maturity.png\"><figcaption>Figure 5. Bottlenecks to AI adoption with AI maturity level.</figcaption></figure>\n",
      "<p>By a 2:1 margin, respondents in companies that are evaluating AI are much more likely to cite an unsupportive culture as the primary bulwark to AI adoption. This disparity is striking—and intriguing. Is it just the case that late-adopters are <em>ipso facto</em> more resistant to—less open to—AI?</p>\n",
      "<p>By contrast, AI adopters are about one-third more likely to cite problems with missing or inconsistent data. We saw in our “<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-state-of-data-quality-in-2020/\">State of Data Quality in 2020</a>” survey that ML and AI projects tend to surface latent or hidden data quality issues, with the result that organizations that are using ML and AI are more likely to identify issues with the quality or completeness of their data. The logic in this case partakes of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in%2C_garbage_out\">garbage-in, garbage out</a>: data scientists and ML engineers need quality data to train their models. Companies evaluating AI, by contrast, may not yet know to what extent data quality can create AI woes.</p>\n",
      "<h2>AI/ML skill shortages: Consistent and persistent</h2>\n",
      "<p>We asked survey respondents to identify the most critical ML- and AI-specific skills gaps in their organizations. The shortage of ML modelers and data scientists topped the list, cited by close to 58% of respondents. The challenge of understanding and maintaining a set of business use cases came in at number two, cited by almost half of participants. (Survey takers could choose more than one selection.) Close to 40% selected data engineering as a practice area for which skills are lacking. Finally, just under one quarter highlighted a lack of compute infrastructure skills.</p>\n",
      "<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"AI/ML skills gaps within organizations\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/6-skills-gaps.png\"><figcaption>Figure 6. AI/ML skills gaps within organizations.</figcaption></figure>\n",
      "<p>The most remarkable thing about these results is their year-over-year consistency. The same skill areas that were problematic in 2019 are again problematic in 2020—and by about the same margins. In 2019, 57% of respondents cited a lack of ML modeling and data science expertise as an impediment to ML adoption; this year, slightly more—close to 58%—did so. This is true of other in-demand skills, too. The uncomfortable truth is that the most critical skill shortages cannot easily be addressed. The data scientist, for example, is a hybrid creature: ideally, she should possess not only theoretical and technical expertise, but practical, domain-specific business expertise, too.</p>\n",
      "<p>This last is almost always acquired in practice, with the result that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/428f1502-2b5c-11e8-9b4b-bc4b9f08f381\">the freshly minted data scientist</a> is invariably trained on the job. This helps explain why the proportion of respondents who cited a shortage of people skilled in understanding and maintaining business use cases increased year over year, from 47% in 2019 to 49% this year. The data scientist uses her domain-specific expertise to identify appropriate business use cases for AI. The ML modeler supplements her technical competency with domain-specific business knowledge that she accrues in practice. Both types of practitioner must also develop <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_skills\">soft skills</a> in team work, listening, and, most important, <a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/articles/book-review-empathy-at-work/\">empathy</a>. This takes time and is a function of experience.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Managing AI/ML risk</h2>\n",
      "<p>We asked respondents to select all of the applicable risks they try to control for in building and deploying ML models. The results suggest that <em>all</em> organizations—especially those with “mature” AI practices—are alert to the risks inherent in the design and use of ML and AI technologies.</p>\n",
      "<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Risks checked for during ML model building and deployment (with AI adoption maturity level)\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/7-risks.png\"><figcaption>Figure 7. Risks checked for during ML model building and deployment (with AI adoption maturity level).</figcaption></figure>\n",
      "<p>Unexpected outcomes/predictions was the single most common risk factor, cited by close to two-thirds of mature—and by about 53% of still-evaluating—AI practitioners. Among mature adopters, the need to control for the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08883.pdf\">interpretability and transparency</a> of ML models was the second most common risk factor (cited by about 55%); by contrast, a different option—fairness, bias, and ethics (~40%)—was the No. 2 risk factor among companies still evaluating AI. It ranks high (No. 3) with mature AI practitioners, too: ~48% check for fairness and bias during model building and deployment.</p>\n",
      "<p>Mature AI practitioners are significantly more likely to implement checks for model degradation than companies that are still evaluating AI. Model degradation is the No. 4 risk factor among mature adopters (checked for by about 46%); however, it is next to last among organizations that are in the evaluation phase of AI adoption—finishing ahead of the “Other compliance” category.</p>\n",
      "<p>These risk factors are common, well understood, and don’t stand alone. With respondents able to pick “all that apply” to the question, we find that 41% of respondents list at least four issues, and 61% select at least three issues.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Supervised learning is dominant, deep learning continues to rise</h2>\n",
      "<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning\">Supervised learning</a> remains the most popular ML technique among all adopters. In 2019, more than 80% of mature adopters—and two-thirds of respondent organizations that were then evaluating AI—used it. And in 2020, almost 73% of self-identified “mature” AI practices are using it. (The survey questionnaire encouraged respondents to select all applicable techniques.)</p>\n",
      "<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"AI technologies organizations are using (with AI adoption maturity level)\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/8-ai-technologies.png\"><figcaption>Figure 8. AI technologies organizations are using (with AI adoption maturity level).</figcaption></figure>\n",
      "<p>This year, however, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning\">deep learning</a> displaced supervised learning as the most popular technique among organizations that are in the evaluation phase of AI adoption. To wit: in respondent organizations that are evaluating AI, slightly more say they’re using deep learning (~55%) than supervised learning (~54%). And close to 66% of respondents who work for “mature” AI adopters say they’re using deep learning, making it the second most popular technique in the mature cohort—behind supervised learning.</p>\n",
      "<p>It’s true that usage of all ML or AI techniques is greater among mature adopters than among organizations still evaluating AI. That said, there are a number of striking differences between mature and less mature AI adopters. For example, about 23% of “mature” AI practices use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning\">transfer learning</a>, nearly double the rate of usage in less mature practices (12%). <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/humans-loop-design-interactive-ai-systems\">Human-in-the-loop</a> AI models are considerably more popular among mature users than among those still evaluating AI.</p>\n",
      "<p>Selecting the right tool for the job has more than three-quarters (78%) of respondents selecting at least two of ML techniques, 59%, using at least three, and 39% choosing at least four.</p>\n",
      "<h2>The dominant tools aren’t getting any less dominant</h2>\n",
      "<p>TensorFlow remains, by far, the single most popular tool for use in AI-related work. It was cited by almost 55% of respondents in both 2019 and 2020, which gives it a creditable consistency over time.</p>\n",
      "<p>TensorFlow’s staying power also reinforces the fact that deep learning and neural networks—with which it is strongly associated—are far from niche techniques.</p>\n",
      "<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"AI tools organizations are using\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/9-ai-tools.png\"><figcaption>Figure 9. AI tools organizations are using.</figcaption></figure>\n",
      "<p>The most popular tools for AI development in 2019 were once again predominant in 2020. This could be a function of what we’ll call the “Python factor,” however: four of the five most popular tools for AI-related work are either Python-based or <a href=\"https://octoverse.github.com/\">dominated by Python tools, libraries, patterns, and projects</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p>Of these, TensorFlow, <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/\">scikit-learn</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras\">Keras</a> held steady, while PyTorch grew its share to more than 36%. This tracks with usage and search activity on the O’Reilly online learning platform, where interest in PyTorch has grown quickly from a relatively small base. Our <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/oreilly-2020-platform-analysis\">analysis of Python-related activity on O’Reilly</a> likewise shows that Python is seeing explosive growth in ML and AI-related development.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Data governance isn’t yet a priority</h2>\n",
      "<p>Slightly more than one-fifth of respondent organizations have implemented formal data governance processes and/or tools to support and complement their AI projects. This is consistent with the results of <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-state-of-data-quality-in-2020/\">our data quality survey</a>.</p>\n",
      "<p>The good news is that just over 26% of respondents say their organizations plan to instantiate formal data governance processes and/or tools by 2021; almost 35% expect this to happen in the next three years. The bad news is that AI adopters—much like organizations everywhere—seem to treat data governance as an additive rather than an essential ingredient.</p>\n",
      "<p>Ideally, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance#Science\">data provenance</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lineage\">data lineage</a>, consistent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_specification\">data definitions</a>, rich <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_management\">metadata management</a>, and other essentials of good data governance would be baked into, not grafted on top of, an AI project.</p>\n",
      "<p>Think of data governance as analogous to <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/distributed-systems-observability/9781492033431/ch01.html\">observability</a> in software development: it is easier to build a capacity for observability into a system than to retrofit an existing system to make it observable. In the same way, it is easier to build a capacity for data governance into a system or service than to “add” it after the fact. Data governance is a data-specific take on observability that not only permits traceability and reproducibility, but permits transparency into what an AI asset is doing—and how it’s doing it.</p>\n",
      "<h2>Takeaways</h2>\n",
      "<p>A review of the survey results yields a few takeaways organizations can apply to their own AI projects.</p>\n",
      "<ul>\n",
      "<li>If you do not have plans to evaluate AI, it’s time to think about catching up. With an abundance of open source tools, libraries, tutorials, etc., not to mention an accessible <em>lingua franca</em>—Python—the bar for entry is actually pretty low. Most companies are experimenting with AI—why risk being left behind?</li>\n",
      "<li>AI projects align with dominant trends in software architecture and infrastructure and operations. AI features can be decomposed into functional primitives and instantiated as microservices—e.g., data cleansing services that profile data and generate statistics, perform deduplication and fuzzy matching, etc.—or function-as-a-service designs.</li>\n",
      "<li>Think broadly: AI is used everywhere, not just in R&amp;D and IT. A large share of survey respondents use AI in customer service, marketing, operations, finance, and other domains.</li>\n",
      "<li>Train your organization, too—not just your models. Institutional support remains the biggest barrier to AI adoption. If you think AI can help, you should spend time explaining how, why, and what to expect.</li>\n",
      "<li>The risks associated with AI implementation are consistent and now better understood. The upshot is that it’s easier to explain to executives and stakeholders what to expect in implementing AI projects.</li>\n",
      "</ul>\n",
      "<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>\n",
      "<p>Clearly, we see AI practices maturing, even if many production use cases appear primitive. Adopters are also taking proactive steps to control for the most common risk factors. Both mature and not-so-mature adopters are experimenting with sophisticated techniques to build their AI products and services. Adopters are using a wide variety of ML and AI tools, but have coalesced around a single language—the ubiquitous, irrepressible Python. However, organizations need to address important data governance and data conditioning to expand and scale their AI practices.</p>\n",
      "<hr>\n",
      "<aside data-type=\"sidebar\">\n",
      "<p id=\"_ftn1\"><a href=\"#F1\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> We define “production” as the use of AI models in deployed applications that either serve users or are exposed as part of an automated, repeatable process—such as data collection, profiling, cleansing, and engineering.

      "<p id=\"_ftn2\"><a href=\"#F2\"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a> We asked participants to distinguish between “mature” adoption and “evaluation” on the basis of the following criteria: “None” (no use of AI in any projects); “Evaluation” (limited to trial evaluations and proofs-of-concept); “Analysis” (exploring, classifying, summarizing, and organizing data); and “Production” (revenue-bearing AI projects that are used in production). We group those respondents that selected “Analysis” and “Production” into our “mature” cohort.</p>\n",

      "It’s an unprecedented crisis: 8 things to do right now\n",
      "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/zsrywhHLzI8/\n",
      "<p>Even with a stellar crisis plan, the COVID-19 pandemic presents a set of challenges unprecedented in our lifetimes. We don’t know what’s going to happen, and we’re dealing with something growing exponentially, creating uncertainty on a global scale. I managed a team of 40 in Singapore during SARS. That crisis was different, hitting Singapore and a handful of other cities. But plenty of parallels exist: it was a health crisis, and the lessons learned might serve you and your organization well now. Here are some things to do immediately, including addressing issues around remote work, to ensure that business continues as usual.</p>\n",
      "<ol>\n",
      "<li><strong>This <em>is</em> your full-time job right now</strong>. Whatever was on your priority list last month, isn’t anymore. This is your full-time job right now. That means you may need to tell the C-suite that their pet project has been delayed, and you may need to tell employees that performance reviews and team meetings are on hold. You and your team may be working very long days in the coming weeks.</li>\n",
      "<li><strong>Push communications twice a day</strong>. In the arc of a crisis, we don’t know quite where we are—and that uncertainty can cause panic for some employees. News is coming out fast and good information is hard to come by. Create a morning and late afternoon update so your people know you are paying attention to their well-being. Share new information and repeat facts you already know. As we move from crisis to recovery—and we will recover—your updates can move from twice a day back to once a day and, then, less often.</li>\n",
      "<li><strong>Let go of perfection</strong>. It’s better to send out a revised set of rules everyday rather than being silent for days while executives try to land on the perfect policy and ideal language. Modify standard policies and make exceptions to long-held rules. Be transparent—it’s OK not to have all the answers because there are few definitive answers. Be transparent and say what you know and admit what you don’t know.</li>\n",
      "<li><strong>Monitor the CDC and your state health authorities</strong>. There will be rumors, fake news, and speculation. The only thing we know is that we have never been through this before. In 1918 during the Spanish Flu, it took days to cross the Atlantic and antibiotics hadn’t been invented. Because this is unprecedented in our modern world, the CDC and your state health authorities are doing admirable work providing the most reliable and trustworthy information.</li>\n",
      "<li><strong>People will respond very differently—prepare for that to cause problems</strong>. Some people may begin refusing to come to work—others might seem cavalier about COVID19. That divide may create serious friction in your organization. People who come to work begin to resent those who don’t. Those who stay home begin to believe that some of their co-workers don’t care about the health of families. After SARS, it took a long time to heal this split in the office. Acknowledge the split and that both points of view are valid.</li>\n",
      "<li><strong>Create new remote work guidelines—today</strong>. It doesn’t matter if you change these guidelines (see #3), just put out some basics. Is there a daily meeting? Will teams need to check in every day? What tools should they use? Should all meeting participants turn on their video? Whatever you decide—put out some guidelines so people have a place to start. You can modify these tomorrow and completely rewrite them when the crisis passes.</li>\n",
      "<li><strong>We may not return to “business as usual.”</strong> You are going to want to reassure people, and that may be an important part of your job. Tell people it will be OK—because it will. But be careful: don’t make any promises, because “OK” may not mean what it used to mean. Companies will likely make changes during the crisis or as things begin to recover. And, this may be an opportunity to change how your organization works. You are going to learn things about how your people learn, adapt, and improvise that will inform the new future.</li>\n",
      "<li><strong>Take care of yourself</strong>. This is a marathon not a sprint. And, to carry that metaphor forward, we don’t know the course of the marathon. We know some of you have been working around the clock—that’s not going to end tomorrow. If you aren’t healthy and grounded, you can’t see your team through this. Ground yourself; whatever gives you peace and contentment—you need that now, for you, for your family, and for the demands of your work.</li>\n",

      "Compliance functions are powerful because legal violations result in clear financial costs. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for instance, imposes fines of up to 2%–4% of global annual revenue. Fines in the billions have been levied against Google and Facebook, and Practice Fusion (an electronic medical records company) has agreed to a $145 million settlement for using “its EHR software to influence physician prescribing of opioid pain medications.”\n",

      "Because of its clear impact on the bottom line, compliance often reshapes business operations. Here, the public discovered that even highly experienced senators didn’t fully understand key technologies, like Facebook, much less their potential harm on users. Furthermore, compliance-only companies will play a seemingly insurmountable game of “whack-a-mole” as new data regulations pass around the world. An ethics leader protects users and workers in its operations by using governance best practices. When creating the product, it uses data protection by design, working with cross-functional roles like legal and privacy engineers to embed ethical principles into the lifecycle of the product and formalize data-sharing agreements. Before launching, it audits the product thoroughly and conducts scenario planning to understand potential ethical mishaps, such as perceived or real gender bias or human rights violations in its supply chain. Ethics leaders also fight for users and workers, who can be forgotten. With social movements, leaders fight powerful actors preying on vulnerable communities or the public at large—and critically examines and ameliorates its own participation in systemic violence. Finally, ethics leaders empower their users and workers. Alison Taylor, the Executive Director of Ethical Systems, argues that internal processes should “improve [workers’] reasoning and creativity, instead of short-circuiting them.” Enabling this is a culture of psychological safety and training to engage kindly with divergent ideas. For instance, Apple has implemented some provisions of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation for all US residents—not just EU and CA residents—including the ability to access and edit data.

      "As demonstrated by the waves of ethical “principles” released by Fortune 500 companies and commissions, ethics programs can be murky, dominated by a white, male, and Western interpretation. When companies substitute unaccountable data ethics principles for thoughtful engagement with the enforceable data regulation principles, users will be harmed. In recessions, these “soft” programs may be the first on the chopping block. To move beyond narrow interpretations of ethics, ethical leaders must engage with critiques—like the Feminist Data Manifest-no. Similarly, leaders must engage with international human rights frameworks (IHRFs), such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. To gain more buy-in from top internal business leaders, ethics leaders can form coalitions with compliance, data, and even marketing departments. By leading programs with resources and measurable accountability, ethics leaders must articulate how ethics improves trust and loyalty. The effectiveness of such coalitions may explain the rise of chief ethics and compliance officers— as well as a host of new chief trust, social responsibility, citizenship, and data officers by technology leaders like Salesforce, Workday, and Unisys. These include those focused (a) on specific technologies like AI, such as The Partnership on AI, (b) on specific industries, such as health (All-in), government (Civic Data Privacy Leaders Network), and cities (Cities Coalition for Digital Rights or the Right to the City Alliance); or (c) on a general set of emerging issues, such as IEEE, WEF, Metrolab, or Data Collaboratives Research Network.

      "Data Governance sounds like a candidate for the most boring topic in technology: something dreamed up by middle-managers to add friction to data scientists’ lives. They were experimenting with machine learning and artificial intelligence; they were building models that could easily go astray (with embarrassing repercussions) if they were based on data that was out of date or erroneous. What did the data scientists need? What did the compliance experts need? The problem boils down to managing metadata—the data about the data, the data that describes the data. Data that hasn’t been used for a few years probably hasn’t been used for a good reason. How does this look in practice? The open source project Amundsen was started to enable data discovery at Lyft. Although Amundsen was built to solve a supposedly different problem, it has also become a tool for data governance. It’s really about metadata management, and that’s at the heart of data governance. It won’t prevent someone from accessing data they shouldn’t; it just lets you document what happened after the fact. It also doesn’t track data lineage (at least, not yet), although users can add metadata about how data is modified and remixed. So it’s not a complete solution—but it’s a step toward a solution. Going beyond metadata management, many data governance platforms are designed to enforce data access policies.\n",

If the needle doesn’t move, you will undermine your team. Customers want you to solve their problems; they don’t care what kind of neural network you’re using.

      "If you’re already a software product manager (PM), you have a head start on becoming a PM for artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML). A PM for AI needs to do everything a traditional PM does, but they also need an operational understanding of machine learning software development along with a realistic view of its capabilities and limitations. Why AI software development is different\n",
      "AI products are automated systems that collect and learn from data to make user-facing decisions. Pragmatically, machine learning is the part of AI that “works”: algorithms and techniques that you can implement now in real products. All you need to know for now is that machine learning uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to “learn” by being trained on existing data. AI systems differ from traditional software in many ways, but the biggest difference is that machine learning shifts engineering from a deterministic process to a probabilistic one. In the best case scenario, the trained neural network accurately represents the underlying phenomenon of interest and produces the correct output even when presented with new input data the model didn’t see during training. For machine learning systems used in consumer internet companies, models are often continuously retrained many times a day using billions of entirely new input-output pairs. The same neural network code trained with seemingly similar datasets of input and output pairs can give entirely different results. Make changes to the training data, repeat the training process with the same code, and you’ll get different output predictions from your model. Predicting development time is hard enough for traditional software, but at least we can make some general guesses based on past experience. You frequently don’t know whether something is feasible until you do the experiment. Your team also needs to solve a cold start problem so you can recommend movies before the system begins collecting user feedback data (typically solved by using contextual topic-based or popularity-based recommendations), but once you gather explicit user ratings and video viewing data, you should be able to build a reasonable system. These issues may be unexpected for teams that aren’t familiar with developing machine learning systems trained on user-generated content. In each of these examples, the machine learning problem faced by the business was similar (recommend movies to users), but the required approach ended up being very different based on subtle differences in the data and product design. Job recommendations also include additional algorithmic and regulatory challenges related to diversity, bias, and fairness that are not encountered in movie recommendations. There are strategies for dealing with all of this uncertainty–starting with the proverb from the early days of Agile: “do the simplest thing that could possibly work.” You don’t always need to start with a complex neural network; a simple regression (or even simpler, an average) might be enough to get your project off the ground. In some cases, that simple model may be all you ever need. Organizational prerequisites for AI at scale\n",
      "Particularly at a company that’s new to AI, part of an AI product manager’s job is helping the organization build the culture it needs to succeed with AI. Because it’s so different from traditional software development, where the risks are more or less well-known and predictable, AI rewards people and companies that are willing to take intelligent risks, and that have (or can develop) an experimental culture. As Jeff Bezos has said, “If you only do things where you know the answer in advance, your company goes away.”\n",
      "No company wants to dry up and go away; and at least if you follow the media buzz, machine learning gives companies real competitive advantages in prediction, planning, sales, and almost every aspect of their business. Even simple machine learning projects can be difficult, and managing these projects in a real business is much harder than most people realize; that’s why VentureBeat claims 87% of machine learning products never make it into production, and Harvard Business Review says that “The first wave of corporate AI is bound to fail.” Machine learning is not fairy dust you can sprinkle on your existing product. VentureBeat discusses two reasons for failure: management that believes you can solve problems by throwing money at them (whether that means hiring more, or better, developers), and data that is locked away into silos, where the people building your ML applications can’t get it. It turns out that type of data infrastructure is also the foundation needed for building AI products. The ability to make decisions based on data analytics is a prerequisite for an “experimental culture.” This was the path taken by companies like Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn, which were driven by analytics from the beginning. They’ve built the infrastructure needed to collect, manage, and analyze their data, and deploy AI products that can automatically make user-facing decisions in real time. Just as AI product managers need to help build a culture in which they can succeed, they need to help define and build the infrastructure that will allow an organization to walk, and then to run. Although machine learning projects differ in subtle ways from traditional projects, they tend to require similar infrastructure, similar data collection processes, and similar developer habits. The prospect of taking on a costly data infrastructure project is daunting. According to Lukas Biewald, founder of Figure Eight and Weights & Biases: “Big companies should avoid building their own machine learning infrastructure. Start with a simple project, build your infrastructure, learn how to use your data effectively, build relationships within the organization, then make the leap. Identifying “viable” machine learning problems\n",
      "Any product manager is part of the team that determines what product to build. An AI pilot project, even one that sounds simple, probably won’t be something you can demo quickly. A demo, or even a first release, can be based on heuristics or simple models (linear regression, or even averages). It’s an intuition that you can learn through experience–and it’s why understanding your failures is at least as important as understanding your successes. Build a prototype they can try with real data. It isn’t; you’ve got to go into much more detail about who your customers are, how they want to organize their pictures, what kinds of pictures they’re likely to have, how they want to search, and more. Otherwise, you will burn money paying external services for labeled data, and that up-front cost–before you can do your first demo–can easily be the most expensive part of the project. Without large amounts of good raw and labeled training data, solving most AI problems is not possible. When you’re planning a product, it’s important to have a gut feel for what error rates are achievable and what aren’t, and what error rates are acceptable for your application. Work on things that matter to your business\n",
      "The most important advice we can give is to make sure you work on AI products that matter to the business. It’s entirely too easy to define a problem, spend three to six months solving it, and then find out the solution works, but nobody cares; it doesn’t make a difference to the business. One of a product manager’s most important jobs is ensuring that the team is solving a problem that’s worth solving. You will probably have more ideas than you can possibly use–so how do you prioritize the list of machine learning projects? Shipping any machine learning system requires a huge mountain of organizational and data engineering effort, so the ultimate payoff needs to match that investment. You shouldn’t over-promise, and you shouldn’t under-deliver. If the needle doesn’t move, you will undermine your team. Without this data familiarity, you will have trouble spotting ethical problems that arise from biased or insufficient data. Even if a product is feasible, that’s not the same as product-market fit. Customers want you to solve their problems; they don’t care what kind of neural network you’re using. You may discover that you don’t need AI at all, and that’s just fine. Build a direct connection between your machine learning application and something the company values. A strategic objective for the company was to become the professional profile of record and have complete and up-to-date resume data in the LinkedIn profiles for all professionals. People You May Know (PYMK) was a successful example of this type of strategic alignment from LinkedIn’s data team. Scope often needs to be reduced or quality sacrificed to align with other teams or priorities. In larger companies, it’s best to start by focusing on business units that are eager to work with you and where your help is needed. Ideally, that also aligns with the larger set of company priorities. Resources\n",

      "It requires human labeling to be useful (such as manually labeling emails as “spam” or “not” for a spam detection algorithm). The importance of automating data preparation\n",
      "Most of the conversation around AI automation involves automating machine learning models, a field known as AutoML. This is important: consider how many modern models need to operate at scale and in real time (such as Google’s search engine and the relevant tweets that Twitter surfaces in your feed). “76% of data scientists view data preparation as the least enjoyable part of their work,” according to a CrowdFlower survey. A series of subjective data preparation micro-decisions can bias your analysis. For example, one analyst may throw out data with missing values, another may infer the missing values. Automating data preparation won’t necessarily remove such bias, but it will make it systematic, discoverable, auditable, unit-testable, and correctable. An added benefit is that the work will be reproducible and robust, in the sense that somebody else (say, in another department) can reproduce the analysis and get the same results[7];\n",
      "For the increasing number of real-time algorithms in production, humans need to be taken out of the loop at runtime as much as possible (and perhaps be kept in the loop more as algorithmic managers): when you use Siri to make a reservation on OpenTable by asking for a table for four at a nearby Italian restaurant tonight, there’s a speech-to-text model, a geographic search model, and a restaurant-matching model, all working together in real time. No data analysts/scientists work on this data pipeline as everything must happen in real time, requiring an automated data preparation and data quality workflow (e.g., to resolve if I say “eye-talian” instead of “it-atian”). The third point above speaks more generally to the need for automation around all parts of the data science workflow. Modern tools for automating data cleaning and data preparation\n",
      "We’re seeing the emergence of modern tools for automated data cleaning and preparation, such as HoloClean and Snorkel coming from Christopher Ré’s group at Stanford. HoloClean decouples the task of data cleaning into error detection (such as recognizing that the location “cicago” is erroneous) and repairing erroneous data (such as changing “cicago” to “Chicago”), and formalizes the fact that “data cleaning is a statistical learning and inference problem.” All data analysis and data science work is a combination of data, assumptions, and prior knowledge. So when you’re missing data or have “low-quality data,” you use assumptions, statistics, and inference to repair your data. No other supervision is required!”\n",
      "The HoloClean team also has a system for automating the “building and managing [of] training datasets without manual labeling” called Snorkel. Having correctly labeled data is a key part of preparing data to build machine learning models[10]. Snorkel provides a way to automate labeling, using a modern paradigm called data programming, in which users are able to “inject domain information [or heuristics] into machine learning models in higher level, higher bandwidth ways than manually labeling thousands or millions of individual data points.” Researchers at Google AI have adapted Snorkel to label data at industrial/web scale and demonstrated its utility in three scenarios: topic classification, product classification, and real-time event classification. As we saw from the recent O’Reilly survey, data preparation and cleaning still take up a lot of time that data professionals don’t enjoy. A bright future would see data preparation and data quality as first-class citizens in the data workflow, alongside machine learning, deep learning, and AI. [1] For example, let’s say that you have existing data on how many users on your e-commerce website have clicked on items after a search. According to the paper, “These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions.”\n",
      "\n",
      "[7] Yet another benefit is that building such automated data preparation pipelines is essentially a form of preregistering analytical techniques (specifying your methodology before actually doing it so you can’t alter it as a function of what you find in your data), which also reduces human bias. [8] With automated machine learning packages such as TPOT and drag-and-drop interfaces like Azure’s automated machine learning tool. [10] For example, if you’re building a spam detection model, then you need to feed the model both spam and non-spam emails, labelled correctly as “spam” or “non-spam” (called training data as you use it to train your model). To see how important the challenge of getting good quality labelled data, look no further than data labelling start-up Scale AI’s recent $100 million Series C funding round, which brought their valuation past $1 billion (also note that Scale AI is still using humans to label their data on the back end).\n",

Continuous learning is also required to understand the relationship between humanity and technology. “It’s a matter of how we use it. We need the human mind.”\n",
      "From an HR perspective, Codispoti said, we need to go faster to get our minds ready. Too often, companies try to grasp at the next big thing without laying the foundation for learning first. “There’s a whole world of things to learn,” Codispoti said. “I look at it as an enabler.”\n",

Codispoti said that creating a process requires an end-to-end vision, but silos often lead to fragments being created piecemeal. “Once [a broken process] is enabled through technology and you want to make changes, it’s hard and people blame the technology,” Codispoti said. Making complex projects and transformations more modular creates a parallel impact on people and organizational structures, changing the nature of their responsibilities and spans of control. “It’s a different way of thinking.

We use it as a data source for our annual platform analysis, and we’re using it as the basis for this report, where we take a close look at the most-used and most-searched topics in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) on O’Reilly[1]. Our analysis of ML- and AI-related data from the O’Reilly online learning platform indicates:\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsupervised learning surged in 2019, with usage up by 172%. Reinforcement learning fell by 5% in 2019; it’s up hugely—1,500+%—since 2017, however. Sustained strength in unsupervised learning, neural networks, reinforcement learning, etc., demonstrates that organizations are experimenting with advanced ML tools and methods. AI/ML topics on the O’Reilly online learning platform with the most usage in 2019 (left) and the rate of change for each topic (right). Growth in ML and AI is unabated\n",
      "Engagement with the artificial intelligence topic continues to grow, up 88% in 2018 and 58% in 2019 (see Figure 1), outpacing share growth in the much larger machine learning topic (+14% in 2018, up 5% in 2019). Aggregating artificial intelligence and machine learning topics accounts for nearly 5% of all usage activity on the platform, a touch less than, and growing 50% faster than, the well-established “data science” topic (see Figure 2). Data engineering remains the largest topic in the data category with just over 8% usage share on the platform (Figure 2). High-level data topics on the O’Reilly online learning platform with the most usage (left) and and the rate of change for each topic (right). Unsupervised learning is growing\n",
      "Interest in the unsupervised learning topic increased significantly, with usage up by 53% in 2018 and by 172% in 2019[2] (see Figure 1). It’s likely, too, that the visible success of unsupervised learning in neural networks and deep learning[3] has helped spur interest, as has the diversity of open source tools, libraries, tutorials, etc., that support unsupervised learning. These closely related topics are popular: aggregating neural networks, deep learning, and TensorFlow usage nets nearly half (47%) of all AI/ML category usage, showing a slight decline (-3%) in 2019 after growing 24% in 2018. In our “AI adoption in the enterprise 2020” survey, we found that deep learning was the most popular ML method among companies that are evaluating AI. Among companies using AI to support production use cases, deep learning was No. 2[4]. It might be that—at 1% of platform usage and 22% of all AI/ML usage—deep learning has approached its asymptote. Probably more noise than trend, moreover, computer vision accounts for about twice as much usage activity as the fast growing unsupervised learning topic. We know from our annual analysis of usage and search on the O’Reilly online learning platform that one of Python’s fastest areas of growth is in ML- and AI-related development. The shift to “artificial intelligence”\n",
      "Does the growing engagement in neural networks, reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and the increased focus on putting models into production augur a shift in how practitioners in the space frame what they do? We think yes, with practitioners increasingly calling their work “artificial intelligence”—a notion supported by the growth in AI usage on O’Reilly, the increasing embrace of sophisticated tools, and the empirical trend of putting those tools into production, which we see in our AI surveys. Tools and techniques like reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning open up new use cases, including decision support, interactive games, real-time retail recommendation engines, and data discovery. In fact, we found in our AI adoption survey that those new to ML are almost as likely to experiment with deep learning as mature adopters. We compared aggregated data for the last three years; a full year of data for 2017 and 2018, and through the end of October for 2019. Share for specific applications (e.g., deep learning) is much higher. However, research into either topic is likely to surface the connection to unsupervised learning, as well as to reinforcement learning, transfer learning, etc. [4] In “AI adoption in the enterprise 2020” we found that two thirds of mature AI adopters and 55% of organizations that are evaluating AI are using deep learning.\n",

      "The majority (85%) of respondent organizations are evaluating AI or using it in production[1]. More than half of respondent organizations identify as “mature” adopters of AI technologies: that is, they’re using AI for analysis or in production. Supervised learning is the most popular ML technique among mature AI adopters, while deep learning is the most popular technique among organizations that are still evaluating AI. Though a problem, the lack of ML and AI skills isn’t the biggest impediment to AI adoption. Few organizations are using formal governance controls to support their AI efforts. Respondent demographics\n",
      "Survey respondents represent 25 different industries, with “Software” (~17%) as the largest distinct vertical. The survey does have a data-laden tilt, however: almost 30% of respondents identify as data scientists, data engineers, AIOps engineers, or as people who manage them. What is more, almost three-quarters of survey respondents say they work with data in their jobs. Analysis: The state of AI adoption today\n",
      "More than half of respondent organizations are in the “mature” phase of AI adoption (using AI for analysis/production), while about one-third are still evaluating AI[2]. This is close to a mirror image of last year’s AI survey results, when 54% of respondent organizations were evaluating AI and just 27% were in the “mature” adoption phase. In both 2019 and 2020, the AI skills gap actually occupied the No. This disparity is striking—and intriguing. Is it just the case that late-adopters are ipso facto more resistant to—less open to—AI? AI/ML skills gaps within organizations. The uncomfortable truth is that the most critical skill shortages cannot easily be addressed. The ML modeler supplements her technical competency with domain-specific business knowledge that she accrues in practice. Managing AI/ML risk\n",

Mature AI practitioners are significantly more likely to implement checks for model degradation than companies that are still evaluating AI. 4 risk factor among mature adopters (checked for by about 46%); however, it is next to last among organizations that are in the evaluation phase of AI adoption—finishing ahead of the “Other compliance” category. In 2019, more than 80% of mature adopters—and two-thirds of respondent organizations that were then evaluating AI—used it. And in 2020, almost 73% of self-identified “mature” AI practices are using it. (The survey questionnaire encouraged respondents to select all applicable techniques.) Figure 8. This year, however, deep learning displaced supervised learning as the most popular technique among organizations that are in the evaluation phase of AI adoption. The dominant tools aren’t getting any less dominant\n",
      "TensorFlow remains, by far, the single most popular tool for use in AI-related work. It was cited by almost 55% of respondents in both 2019 and 2020, which gives it a creditable consistency over time. The most popular tools for AI development in 2019 were once again predominant in 2020. Of these, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and Keras held steady, while PyTorch grew its share to more than 36%. With an abundance of open source tools, libraries, tutorials, etc., not to mention an accessible lingua franca—Python—the bar for entry is actually pretty low. AI projects align with dominant trends in software architecture and infrastructure and operations. Concluding thoughts\n",
      "Clearly, we see AI practices maturing, even if many production use cases appear primitive. Both mature and not-so-mature adopters are experimenting with sophisticated techniques to build their AI products and services.\n",

      "Freeman Dyson died last week at the age of 96 after injuring himself in a fall in the cafeteria at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Princeton, where he had continued to work right up to the end. Perhaps the most famous example is the paper he wrote in 1949 at the age of 25 making the case that the visualizations of Richard Feynman were mathematically equivalent to the calculations of the more conventional physicists Julian Schwinger and Shin’ichirō Tomonaga, a paper that led to Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga receiving the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics for the theory of quantum electrodynamics. “I visited him recently,” Danny wrote, “and we got into a conversation about self-organizing systems. We see the world through the lens of our received ideas, but for most of us, words predominate. Freeman was good at that, too. It is so good that over the years, I’ve managed to get only about halfway through the book, since each time I pick it up, I first re-read Freeman’s foreword. Jonson and Shakespeare were both successful playwrights. Jonson was learned and scholarly, Shakespeare was slapdash and a genius. Shakespeare was nine years older, already filling the London stage with masterpieces before Jonson began to write. The play was a resounding success and launched Jonson’s professional career. Jonson was then aged 25, Shakespeare 34. Jonson became famous in his own right as a poet and scholar, and at the end of his life he was honored with burial in Westminster Abbey. He was not interested in publishing pretty papers. Then he began to calculate numbers, using his diagrams as a guide. With astonishing speed he was able to calculate physical quantities that could be compared directly with experiment.\n",

      "The problem with the claim that Agile is “dead” is that, as Eben Hewitt said to me in a conversation, “no movement has succeeded until it has become a parody of itself.” This is a brilliant point that applies perfectly to Agile. More often than not, the result of fetishization is—nothing at all. I won’t be among the mourners. This is important. Agile is not, and never was, about getting developers to write software faster. If you were involved with professional programming in the 80s and 90s, you may remember how radical it was (and, in many shops, still is) to put software developers in touch with users and customers. They might tell the customer that some feature they want is impossible! You can’t create a “product owner” and say that’s their job—especially since, more often than not, “product owners” don’t have meaningful contact with customers themselves. We were very lucky not to be sued.) When a project is going off track because some requirement wasn’t understood properly, you need to fix that as soon as possible—not after a year-long development process. If Agile’s first principle is frequent interaction with the customer, its second (and a close corollary) is frequent mid-course corrections. And that’s a big clue about what the word “Agile” means. It’s about correcting small mistakes before they become big ones, before they’re amplified by a multi-year, multi-million dollar budget. Large projects are necessary, but they have a momentum that tends to drive them off course. ), and will remain true after Agile. Progress in developing software tends to be slow, incremental, and fairly well understood. It’s reasonable to have something to demo in two weeks (or whatever interval you choose). (Perhaps the appropriate yardstick for AI projects is the experiment itself, not the code committed to git.) But again: value interactions over documentation. Why, when things change do they remain the same? In any organization, answering those questions will say a lot about how Agile becomes self-parody. Also: infrastructure and operations is trending up, while DevOps is trending down. Growth is still strong for such a large topic, but usage slowed in 2018 (+13%) and cooled significantly in 2019, growing by just 7%. There’s plenty of security risks for business executives, sysadmins, DBAs, developers, etc., to be wary of. We also recently conducted a survey looking at the state of data quality. Data scientists and analysts, data engineers, and the people who manage them comprise 40% of the audience; developers and their managers, about 22%. Data quality might get worse before it gets better. Just 20% of organizations publish data provenance and data lineage. Adopting AI can help data quality.\n",
