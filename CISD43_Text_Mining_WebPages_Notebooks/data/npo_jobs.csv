At Springwell, we are serious about our mission. For more than 40 years, our staff has worked to help ensure that seniors and individuals with disabilities have the village they need and the support that is necessary for them to live at home with dignity and independence.
We are also serious about our employees. We are focused on creating a supportive, and welcoming environment that values each and every member of our staff. At Springwell we are fiercely committed to creating equal opportunities for all regardless of race, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, gender expression, national origin, age, language, and physical or mental disabilities.

Continuous Quality Improvement: We honor the fact that each of us is human, and we embrace a desire to examine the value and quality of our work and ask how we can provide a higher quality of service.
Transparency: While we don't claim to be 100% transparent (there are certain things, like salaries and performance evaluations that are private) we continuously strive to be as open as possible.
Balance: Life is a give and take, as is work. We are always examining that balance. Today, we have yoga classes on-site twice a week. We are exploring offering a Weight Watchers meeting. And afternoon meditation is under consideration. If there is a holiday to celebrate we have a party. This year, we built a dedicated lactation room for new moms.

Quantum Energy hardware has arrived. We are the only non-profit in the world that consolidated scientists to answer the continual global cry for Climate Change. Our current global path we are on is not sustainable and Quantum energy and applications are the only real answer. Our team members consist of well-respected seasoned Quantum scientists, authors, and lecturers who graciously acknowledge the past work of Nikola Tesla, Max Planck and a host of quantum masters including those that passed in the more recent years. 

Management has an Institutional background and are also significant donors. They are known by numerous Countries and prominent companies. The Vaccine for COVID-19 has our focus as it should and our world will be changed because of this. Let’s not forget our home - planet earth. It is also sick. Was the COVID-19 an outcome of how we are treating our planet?

The time is now for us to make this shift and return ourselves and our children back to a sense of well-being and a life full of peace and abundance. The people make this decision and our role is the steward to make this happen and ask for your support in this nonprofit challenge.

Our primary focus includes education of a myriad of quantum applications starting with teaching children through all avenues of education, including story books. 100 Acres of land has already been donated for the Research and Educational Center University using online education. 

These Quantum applications replace all forms of CO2 generation our largest immediate challenge. Chemistry changes in the nanoworld and it applies to all forms of travel (including space), soil, food, water, AI and a myriad of so many more restorative applications. International University reports even show indicators of clearing nuclear contamination. Another University report with energy performance.

The achievements to date consist of operable functioning equipment, prototypes, and proof of concepts, university studies, patents issued and pending. This investment donation phase has been broken down into separate use of funds into 4 technologies each with many applications to hedge any perceived risk or doubts. 

In our end of life decisions there is no greater act of Love and fulfilling our sense of purpose than supporting our children’s future and protect them. It is the fundamental goal and we feel that obligation from our entire team and ask you to join us.

Our minimum goal is $75 Million in matching asset cash funds. Small donations are accepted and Grant writers come please join us. We also will provide the appropriate IRS donation certificate. If you choose to be a part of our goals we look forward to hearing from you. Those who respond, please respectfully identify your role and authority with your fund which will be held under the strictest confidentiality. Curiosity seekers please avoid answering. What you can do is notify candidates that would want to know about donating to this effort.
